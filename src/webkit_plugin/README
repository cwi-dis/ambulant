This directory contains the Ambulant WebKit plugin for MacOSX, version 2.3.

This plugin allows Safari, OmniWeb and other WebKit-based browsers to play back
SMIL content in a web page.

Installation from a binary distribution is simple: 
- drag AmbulantWebKitPlugin.plugin to either ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins (to
  install for the current user) or /Library/Internet Plug-Ins (to install for
  all users, requires Administrator permission). Create this folder if it does
  not exist yet.
- NOTE: you must restart Safari before the new plugin can be used.
  
More information on the Ambulant Player and plugin can be found via

Building from source (if you read these instructions in a source distribution
setting) is done with XCode, using the
projects/xcode32/AmbulantWebkitPlugin.xcodeproj project file.
