This directory contains the Ambulant WebKit plugin for MacOSX, version 2.3.

This plugin allows Safari, OmniWeb and other WebKit-based browsers to play back
SMIL content in a web page.

Installation from a binary distribution is simple: 
- drag AmbulantWebKitPlugin.plugin to either ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins (to
  install for the current user) or /Library/Internet Plug-Ins (to install for
  all users, requires Administrator permission). Create this folder if it does
  not exist yet.
- NOTE: you must restart Safari before the new plugin can be used.
  
More information on the Ambulant Player and plugin can be found via
<http://www.ambulantPlayer.org>

Building from source (if you read these instructions in a source distribution
setting):
- Build ambulant player with the normal configure/make combo, see the toplevel
  INSTALL file for details.
- In the build directory, in src/libambulant/.libs, create symlinks "libambulant_*.dylib"
  to the corresponding "libambulant_*.0" files.
- Open XCode and set (Preferences->Source Trees) PREBUILT_AMBULANT_ROOT the
  the absolute path where you built ambulant, in the step above.
- Build AmbulantWebKitPlugin.xcodeproj with XCode. This expects the ambulant
  engine library in src/libambulant/.libs, so if you have built the player
  outside of the source tree (as the toplevel INSTALL suggests) you need to
  add a single symlink in the source tree. This will be fixed in a later release.
  

Debugging from XCode:
If your login happens to be "jack" everything is setup for debugging. But
otherwise you have to rename the jack.* files within the xcodeproject.
Or follow the guidelines at <http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2006/qa1500.html>
and re-create that setup for yourself.
