This directory contains the source for the Cocoa-based Ambulant Player for
Mac OS X.

The normal build procedure is with the standard unix automake/configure/make
tools. However, an XCode project is available here too, fullcocoambulant.pbproj.
This is mainly for easy debugging and testing.

It will require a little fiddling before it works for anyone but me, however:
there are hardcoded pathnames in various of the include directory
and library directory pathnames. This is to work around a bug in XCode
where it does not calculate dependencies correctly for relative pathnames.
