This directory contains the source for the Cocoa-based Ambulant Player for
Mac OS X.

The normal build procedure is with the standard unix automake/configure/make
tools. However, an XCode project is available here too, fullcocoambulant.pbproj.
This is mainly for easy debugging and testing.

It will require a little fiddling before it works for anyone but me, however:
there are hardcoded pathnames in various of the include directory
and library directory pathnames. This is to work around a bug in XCode
where it does not calculate dependencies correctly for relative pathnames.

If you want to do a universal (ppc/intel) builld you first need to make sure
all third party packages are built universally. See
third_party_packages/readme-osx.txt for details.

Next build ambulant normally. This will fail at the link line for
cocoambulant_executable. Copy/paste the line into the Terminal (in the correct
directory), remove the "-L/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8/4.0.0",
run again. For some reason an intel-only directory has been picked up...
