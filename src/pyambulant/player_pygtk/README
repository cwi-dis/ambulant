This directory contains an example of embedding Ambulant in a Python application.
It is a minimal re-implementation of "player_gtk": a GTK-based Ambulant Player.
It has been tested on Linux (and should work on MacOSX).

You need the following prerequisites:
- Python. Testing has been done with 2.5, 2.4 should work too, earlier probably not.
  Obtain it via <http://www.python.org>
- Gtk.
- PyGtk.
- A build of AmbulantPlayer that has support for Gtk and Python (see below).

Next you need to build the prerequisites (and maybe install them too):
- To be filled
  
  Testing Ambulant on Linux is easy: run player_unix/AmbulantPlayer_qt
  Testing Ambulant on MacOSX is a bit more difficult because our Makefile for
  the qt player does not create the .app bundle stuff MacOSX requires. The easiest
  way to do a simple test is copy the Qt example hello.app somewhere, copy AmbulantPlayer_qt
  to hello.app/Contents/MacOSX/hello and run the resulting hello.app.
  
  Testing the Ambulant Python interface is also fairly simple:
  
    python
    >>> import ambulant
    >>> print ambulant.get_version()
    '1.7'
    >>>
