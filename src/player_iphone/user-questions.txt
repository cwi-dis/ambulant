Current open UI design questions (21-Dec-2010)
==============================================

- single tap brings up the control panel, long tap follows a link in the
  SMIL presentation, double tap zooms to natural size or fill screen.
  Are these the right behaviours?
  
- There are currently 2 preferences for initial zoom and positioning of the
  presentation, "center" (the alternative being show in top-left) and "resize"
  (which does fill screen, the alternative being showing the SMIL file in
  natural size). Are these preferences needed, or should we fix these initial
  values? To what? There is a third possible value for resize: "resize if the
  presentation is bigger than the screen, but center it if it is smaller",
  similar to SMIL fit=meetBest. Consider this as a possible answer for the
  behaviour too.

- When you start iAmbulant (not through clicking a link, but manually) we
  start playing back the most recent presentation at approximately the place
  you left off the last time. To get to History or Favorites or anything else
  you tap and press "(i)". Is this the right startup behaviour?
  
- Currently we have a "history" tab, like browser history, which will show
  multiple instances of the same presentation if you played it multiple times.
  The alternative is a "Recent Documents" tab, which will not show duplicates:
  if you play a document again it will move to the top of the list, so it will
  not show duplicates. Which is better?
  (Note: currently duplicates will also occur in Favorites. This is a bug,
  it will be fixed).
  
- Currently if you press "add to favorites" (the little star) while playing back
  a document it will only add that document to the favorites list but continue
  playback. The alternative is that we pause playback and take you to the
  favorites list. Which is preferred?
  
- We use various animations to switch between views. Do these look "logical"
  or should we use different ones? Which ones?
