Installation instructions for installing the AmbulantPlayer Firefox plugin
version 2.1 (xulrunner version, with Firefox and other compliant browsers)
on Linux (32/64 bit):

Remove all file installed for previous versions (if any).

Move or copy the following file from this .zip file to:
$HOME/.mozilla/plugins
(or as root for system-wide installation to: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins)

npambulant.so

Restart Firefox.

For uninstall, remove above files.

Notes:
1. This is an experimental version. Sometimes when npambulant is loaded,
   Firefox may hang or crash.

2. The current version of npambulant is incompatible with nspluginwrapper.
   For root installations, you can disable nspluginwrapper by adding
   ":npambulant*" to the variable IGNORE_WRAP in "/etc/sysconfig/nspluginwrapper"
3. For a 64-bit version, copy npambulant.so-64 in place of npambulant.so 
   in one of the directories mentioned above.

4. A self-contained version of npambulant (without using shared libraries)
   was build as follows.

   # faad2:
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME --without-bmp --disable-shared CFLAGS=-fPIC
   make;make install

   # ffmpeg:
   ./configure --enable-libfaad --enable-pthreads --enable-gpl --enable-x11grab --disable-swscale --disable-shared --extra-cflags=-fPIC\ -O0\ -I/ufs/kees/include --extra-ldflags=-L/ufs/kees/lib --prefix=/ufs/kees --disable-mmx
   # (fPIC and --disable-mmx only for 64 bit)
   make;make install

   ambulant:
   # first configure, build and local install WITHOUT plugin and shared objects (libraries)
   ./configure --without-npambulant --disable-shared --prefix=$HOME CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC --with-live --without-python --without-xerces --without-plugins --without-qt LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib EXTRA_LIBS=-lfaad 
   make;make install
   PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   # next configure WITH plugin and shared libraries (plugin itself is a shared object)
   ./configure --with-npambulant --enable-shared --prefix=$HOME CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC --with-live --without-python --without-xerces --without-plugins --without-qt LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib EXTRA_LIBS=-lfaad 
   # now ONLY build and (local) install npambulant
   (cd src/npambulant;make;make install)
   # This will install npambulant.so in $HOME/.mozilla/plugins, in a form distributable to
   # any machine of the same architecture
