Installation instructions for installing the AmbulantPlayer Firefox plugin
version 2.1 (xulrunner version, with Firefox and other compliant browsers)
on Linux (32/64 bit):

Remove all file installed for previous versions (if any).

Move or copy the following file from this .zip file to:
$HOME/.mozilla/plugins
(or as root for system-wide installation to: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins)

npambulant.so

Restart Firefox.

For uninstall, remove above files.

Notes:
1. This is an experimental version. Sometimes when npambulant is loaded,
   Firefox may hang or crash.

2. The current version of npambulant is incompatible with nspluginwrapper.
   For root installations, you can disable nspluginwrapper by adding
   ":npambulant*" to the variable IGNORE_WRAP in "/etc/sysconfig/nspluginwrapper"
3. For a 64-bit version, copy npambulant.so-64 in place of npambulant.so 
   in one of the directories mentioned above.

4. This version was build with the following options:
   for ambulant:
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC --with-live --without-python --without-xerces --without-plugins --without-qt --with-npambulant LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib EXTRA_LIBS=-lfaad 
   for ffmpeg:
   ./configure --enable-libfaad --enable-pthreads --enable-gpl --enable-x11grab --disable-swscale --disable-shared --extra-cflags=-fPIC -O0 -I/ufs/kees/include --extra-ldflags=-L/ufs/kees/lib --prefix=/ufs/kees --disable-mmx 
   (fPIC and --disable-mmx only for 64 bit)
   In addition, final link was done with .../src/npambulant/linkit, and some
   manual labor as described in comments in that script.
