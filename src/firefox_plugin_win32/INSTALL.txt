This directory contains the Ambulant WebKit plugin for Firefox
on Windows, version 1.6.1.

This plugin allows Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers to play back
SMIL content in a web page.

Installation from a binary distribution is simple: 
- Copy npambulant.dll and nsIAmbulantPlugin.xpt to your Firefox
  plugin directory (Usually "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins").
- Restart Firefox.
  
There is one known issue with the plugin: relative pathnames in the
<embed src="..."> tag do not work, please use absolute pathnames only.
