What's new in Ambulant Player 2.0?
----------------------------------

Highlights of changes between 1.8 and 2.0:

- Full support for SMIL 3.0: inline text through smilText, variables and
  extended customization through SMIL State, pan and zoom to display partial
  images or video, transparency, many more.

- Windows CE support (specifically Windows Mobile 5) has been revived, and
  is now complete.

- Audio and video support have been enhanced. All platforms can now render
  through open source components (ffmpeg, sdl, live555), unifying available
  media types and access methods across platforms. All platforms support rtsp
  playback, http playback and all common media formats. Performance should
  also have increased significantly.

- Redraw has been optimized, especially on Windows. This should give much
  smoother presentations.

- The Firefox plugin (allowing playback of SMIL within web pages) has been
  revived and for the Mac a Safari plugin is also available. The Safari
  plugin can be extended in Python, allowing rich interaction between SMIL
  and HTML.

- Support for extending Ambulant through Python, or embedding Ambulant
  rendering in Python programs has been enhanced.
