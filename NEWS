What's new in Ambulant Player 2.2?
----------------------------------

- We now have a working plugin for at least one browser on each major
  platform. On MacOS, Linux and Windows we have a Firefox plugin (that may also
  work in Google-Chrome, Opera, Safari and other browsers).

  There is also an Internet Explorer plugin for Windows, but
  we are slightly less sure about the quality of this one.
  
- Timing has improved a lot. This is most clear with video, where
  audio and video should now remain synchronized a lot better, but also
  between continuous media and the rest of the presentation.
  
- For SMIL authors: there is a <param> mechanism to select specific
  renderers for a media item. systemComponent allows you to test for
  availability of this renderer.
  For developers, this change also means all renderers are now created
  with a factory function, and these all have the same signature.
  Further, the <prefetch> element is now implemented for audio and video.
  Currently,for audio media items additionally the element:
  <param name="renderer" value="http://www.ambulantplayer.org/component/RendererAudio"/> 
  must be added as a child of the audio media <prefetch> element.

 
- For developers: the build process has been enhanced. We still rely
  on lots of third party libraries, but there is a script now that
  should download and build everything (for Linux and MacOSX developers).
  The configure process has also been rationalized.
  For Windows developers there is a single .vsprops file where all external
  pathhnames are stored.

As usual, many bugs have been fixed too. The details can be found in ChangeLog.
