What's new in Ambulant Player 2.2?
----------------------------------

- This is mainly a cleanup release, incorporating all fixes we have made in the
  last 2 years. It will also be the last release for Windows XP and older MacOSX
  releases (10.6 or earlier).
  
- Windows drawing code is now based on Direct2D, giving alpha blending,
  transparency scalable windows and fullscreen support.
  
- Mac drawing code is now based on CoreGraphics, giving scalable windows and
  fullscreen support.
  
- Media playback is a lot smoother, especially in the case of back-to-back
  videos, and when trying to get data from a slow webserver.
  
- RTSP playback will automatically fallback to TCP if UDP does not work.

As usual, many bugs have been fixed too. The details can be found in ChangeLog.
