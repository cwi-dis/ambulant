Ambulant Player README
======================

This directory contains version 0.5 of Ambulant,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. 
The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Ambulant is distributed as either a source distribution or a
binary installer for a specific platform. This README file
is common to all distributions, see below for instructions on building 
from source.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Currently we have support for:
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Windows
- Windows CE
- Linux for handhelds (Qtopia)

The specific platforms that have been used for testing are:
- Linux: RedHat 9 on fairly recent Intel hardware
- MacOSX: 10.3
- Windows: Windows 2000 and Windows XP on fairly recent Intel hardware
- Windows CE: to be provided
- Linux for handhelds: Zaurus (Sharp SL-5600 PDA).

Supported media types
---------------------

- Text is supported on all platforms, but on MacOSX there is
  no word-wrap, so text can be truncated.
- Images in PNG, JPEG and GIF formats are supported on all
  platforms. Other formats are supported on some platforms.
- Audio:
  - Windows supports audio through DirectX, so all DirectX-compatible
    formats are supported.
  - Windows CE supports only MP3, and cannot mix multiple audio
    streams.
  - MacOSX and Linux support audio through FFMPEG and SDL,
    giving support for MP3 and many other formats, but not
    all codecs may be supported on WMA or QuickTime files.
    Some audio files may be played back at an incorrect sample rate.
- Video:
  - Windows supports video through DirectX.
  - Windows CE does not support video.
  - MacOSX supports video through QuickTime.
  - Linux does not support video.

Networking support
------------------

This release has limited support for networked media. The
presentation itself must be in a local file, media items can
be retrieved via HTTP or RTP/RTSP on some platforms.

SMIL support
------------

This release supports full SMIL 2.0, with the following broad
exceptions:
- Limited support for linking
- No transitions
- No SMIL animation
- tag names must match media type, and no support for mimetypes

Furthermore, you need to have "expat 1.95.7" installed before
building ambulant; "expat" is used for XML-paring of .smil input files
Previous versions of "expat" will not work with ambulant.
For more details read the third_party_packages/readme.txt

On Linux, the aRts implementation is currently not working, use
./configure --without-arts --with-ffmpeg[=<your libavcodec>];
make;make install

Documentation
-------------

Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships
can be found in: Documentation/Design in a source distribution.

Examples
--------

Two example SMIL 2.0 documents are included, more are available
at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>. In a binary distribution the
examples are right in the toplevel distribution directory, in a
source distribution they are in the Extras directory.

The Welcome document is played automatically the very first time you
start the Ambulant Player on MacOSX and can be played manually on other
platforms.

The DemoPresentation document is a slightly more elaborate example with
some variations to show off various features of SMIL, a readme
file is included.

Building from source
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

Obviously you will need a compiler/linker/development environment.
For Windows you need Microsoft Visual Studio .NET version XXXX.
For Linux desktop and MacOSX you need GNU gcc, at least version 3.2.
For Windows CE you need Microsoft Embedded Visual C++ version XXXX.
For Zuarus you need XXXX.

You also need to build and install a couple of third party packages
that Ambulant depends on. All these live in third_party_packages,
and the readme file there contains detailed instructions on the exact
version numbers, download instructions, etc.

These packages can be built from source, but because this may be
difficult on some platforms (especially Windows and the PDA platforms)
we have created archives of pre-configured and pre-built
third_party_packages for a few common platforms. See
<http://www.ambulantplayer.org> or the sourceforge download area for
details.

Building for Linux
------------------

The normal configure/make/make install combo should do the trick.

Building for Mac OS X
---------------------

The normal configure/make/make install combo should do the trick.

Building for Windows
--------------------

For Windows, see instructions in bin/win32.

Building for Zaurus

-------------------
For Zaurus, see detailed instructions in README-ZAURUS.

Building for Windows CE
-----------------------

To be supplied.
