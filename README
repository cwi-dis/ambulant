This directory contains version 0.2 of Ambulant, a playback engine for
SMIL documents. The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

At the moment ambulant only supports playing back a tiny subset of SMIL,
more-or-less the subset as specified by the 3GPP MMS 2.0 specs.
Also, only local media files are supported, no networking yet.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine, a number
of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers and a number
of player applications. Currently we have support for Gtk (on Linux),
Cocoa (on MacOSX) and DirectX (on Windows).

Documentation is sparse, see Documentation/Design for some design
documentation and an overview of the source tree.

Build on Unix with the standard "configure; make" combo, but:
we need a patched version of expat, follow the instructions in
third_party_packages/readme.txt.

If you want to try building with standard expat installed on your
system use "configure --with-expat=/usr", but this is lileky to produce
disappointing results.

The Cocoa player does not get built with the standard "make", you need
to build it manually with XCode. src/player_macosx/cocoambulant.pbproj
is the project to use.

After building you will find a demo player in Test/designtests/demoplayer.
There is a sample document there too, in mmsdoc/mmsdoc.smil.
