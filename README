Ambulant Player README
======================

This directory contains version 1.4 of the Ambulant Player,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. This release supports SMIL 2.1 RC.
The Ambulant homepage at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org> has more information,
also on exploring SMIL 2.1 RC.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Ambulant is distributed as either a source distribution or a
binary installer for a specific platform. This README file
is common to all distributions, see the INSTALL file for instructions on
building from source. The NEWS file has information on what is new
in this release.

Ambulant is Open Source: the license is modified GPL. See the file
COPYING for details. Please note that some of the packages that Ambulant
can optionally use have their own license, so the special exceptions
in the Ambulant license will probably not apply to those packages.
But the bottom line is that everything is at least GPL-compatible.

Feedback
--------

Please let us know about any problem you encounter: first check the FAQ
on the Ambulant homepage. Of course, there is a good chance we are not 
aware of your problem at this stage. In that case, either send email to:
<Ambulant-feedback@ambulantplayer.org> or fill out a bug report at the
sourceforge bug repository, via <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ambulant>.

See www.ambulantplayer.org for other community resources: mailing lists,
demo document repositories, etc. We expect to do bugfix releases fairly
regularly, join the (low-volume) announcements mailing list to be kept
up-to-date.

We are also specifically interested in cooperation: see the website if
you are interested in helping to make Ambulant a better product, or
combining it with your own work, porting to new platforms, etc.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Currently we have support for:
- Windows
- MacOSX
- Linux
- Windows CE
- Linux for handhelds (Qtopia)

The specific platforms that have been used for testing are:
- Windows: Windows 2000 and Windows XP on fairly recent Intel hardware
- MacOSX: 10.3. 10.2 or earlier will not work.
- Linux: RedHat 9/Fedora Core on fairly recent Intel hardware
- Windows CE: PocketPC 2002 on Compaq IPAQ hardware (Strong Arm processors)
- Linux for handhelds: Zaurus (Sharp SL-5600 PDA).

Supported media types
---------------------

- Text is supported on all platforms.
- Images in PNG, JPEG and GIF formats are supported on all
  platforms. Other formats are supported on some platforms.
- Audio:
  - Windows supports audio through DirectX, so all DirectX-compatible
    formats are supported.
  - Windows CE supports only MP3, and cannot mix multiple audio
    streams in this release.
  - MacOSX and Linux support audio through FFMPEG and SDL,
    giving support for MP3 and many other formats, but not
    all codecs may be supported on WMA or QuickTime files.
  - Linux sometimes produces a hiss at the end of an MP3 file.
    This is a known issue with ffmpeg that will be fixed in a later
    release.
- Video:
  - Windows supports video through DirectX.
  - Windows CE does not support video in this release.
  - MacOSX supports video through QuickTime.
  - Linux supports video through FFMPEG. The number of codecs is limited.

Networking support
------------------

This release has support for networked presentations. Streaming 
media items can be retrieved via HTTP on most platforms,
static media items and the SMIL file itself can be retrieved via HTTP.
RTSP support has not been tested very thoroughly, feedback is requested.

SMIL 2.1 support
----------------

This release includes full support for SMIL 2.1 Release Candidate.
All new 2.1 features are implemented on all platforms, with two exceptions:
- backgroundRepeat is not implemented in the Windows CE player
- soundAlign is not implemented in the Windows CE player

The Ambulant homepage, <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>, has more
information on SMIL 2.1 RC, test documents, etc.

SMIL 2.0 support
----------------

This release supports full SMIL 2.0, with the following broad
exceptions:
- tag names must match media type, and no support for mimetypes.
- No %-escapes in URLs, and limited support for data: URLs.
- accessKey is not implemented.

As SMIL 2.0 is a big language there are undoubtedly areas where
we have overseen something. Please let us know if you encounter
problems.

User interface
--------------

The user interface is getting better, but still a bit clunky on some
platforms. There is a logging window in which the player will print
error messages and such, and a preferences/settings dialog that allows
you to select which parser to use (the validating Xerces parser or the
fast expat parser), which level of logging output you want, etc.

Documentation
-------------

Minimal user documentation is available through the Help menu (on
Mac/Linux/Windows, not on WinCE) or in the unix manpage.

Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships can be
found in: Documentation/Design in a source distribution. Detailed
interface documentation of the classes is in Documentation/API (in a
source distribution).

Examples
--------

Two example SMIL 2.0 documents are included, more are available
at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>. In the binary distributions,
examples are placed in the toplevel distribution directory; in
source distributions, they are in the Extras directory.

The Welcome document is played automatically the very first time you
start the Ambulant Player. If you want to see it again you can play
it via the Help menu.

The DemoPresentation document is a slightly more elaborate example with
some variations to show off various features of SMIL, a readme
file is included.

Known problems
--------------

A current list of known problems can be found in the ambulant
sourceforge bug database, accessible via <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.
