This directory contains version 0.4 of Ambulant,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. 
The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

At the moment ambulant only supports playing back a subset of SMIL,
more-or-less the subset as specified by the 3GPP MMS 2.0 specs
Also, only local media files are supported, no networking yet.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Currently we have support for:
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Windows
?? - Zaurus.

?? Audio, image and text playback is supported on these platforms.
Video is only supported on Windows, at the moment.

?? Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships
can be found in: Documentation/Design.

Various example SMIL 2.0 documents can be found in Extras/*.
Not all of them are known to work on all platforms yet.

You need to have "expat 1.95.7" installed before building ambulant;
"expat" is used for XML-paring of .smil input files. Previous
versions of "expat" will not work with ambulant.

For installation on Linux/Unix follow the detailed instructions 
in README-CVS. A GUI player (build with Qt) will be available
in src/player-unix/qt_player. It will play .smil documents
found in Extras/* (first select the .smil document with "File->Open",
then select "Play->Play"). Stop, Pause and re-Open do not work yet.

For MacOS, there is a Cocoa player which does not get built with the
standard "make", you need to build it manually with XCode.
src/player_macosx/cocoambulant.pbproj is the project to use.

For Windows, see instructions in bin/win32.

For Zaurus, see detailed instructions in README-ZAURUS.
