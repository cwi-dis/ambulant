This directory contains a skeleton version of Ambulant.
Documentation is sparse, see Documentation/Design for some design
documentation and an overview of the source tree.

Build with the standard "configure; make" combo, but:
we need a patched version of expat, follow the instructions in
third_party_packages/readme.txt.

If you want to try building with standard expat installed on your
system use "configure --with-expat=/usr", but this is lileky to produce
disappointing results.

After building you will find a demo player in Test/designtests/demoplayer.
There is a sample document there too, in mmsdoc/mmsdoc.smil.
