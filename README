This directory contains version 0.3 of Ambulant,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. 
The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

At the moment ambulant only supports playing back a subset of SMIL,
more-or-less the subset as specified by the 3GPP MMS 2.0 specs
Also, only local media files are supported, no networking yet.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Currently we have support for:
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Windows
- Zaurus (Sharp SL-5600 PDA).

Media support varies on different platforms.
On all platforms text and images is supported,
but the exact image file types supported may differ.
JPEG is supported on all platforms, however.

Audio is supported on Windows through the DirectX layer,
so any audio file type DirectX supports should work.

On Linux mp3 audio playback is supported if you have
SDL and ffmpeg installed.

On MacOSX raw audio is supported if SDL is installed.
Whether libffmpeg availability gives you support for more filetypes
is not clear.

In this release we support on MacOSX and on Linux only mp3s of the 
format 44100 Hz mono. 
For more details on compiling ambulant with ffmpeg
read the third_party_packages/readme.txt

Furthermore, you need to have "expat 1.95.7" installed before
building ambulant; "expat" is used for XML-paring of .smil input files
Previous versions of "expat" will not work with ambulant.
For more details read the third_party_packages/readme.txt

On Linux, the aRts implementation is currently not working, use
./configure --without-arts --with-ffmpeg[=<your libavcodec>];
make;make install

Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships
can be found in: Documentation/Design.

Various example SMIL 2.0 documents can be found in Extras/*.
More  SMIL 2.0 documents can be found in a seperate repository
ambulant-documents, or as a tar ball at www.sourceforge.com.
Note that not all of these examples are known to work
on all platforms yet.

A linux GUI player (build with Qt) will be available
in src/player-unix/qt_player.

For MacOSX, the cocoa player only gets built when you do "make install",
it is deposited in /Applications/cocoambulant.app.

For Windows, see instructions in bin/win32.

For Zaurus, see detailed instructions in README-ZAURUS.
