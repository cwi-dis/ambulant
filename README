Ambulant Player README
======================

This directory contains version 0.5 of Ambulant,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. 
This release is known externally as AMBULANT/X.
It is an intermediate release of the Ambulant Player Project.
The Ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Ambulant is distributed as either a source distribution or a
binary installer for a specific platform. This README file
is common to all distributions, see below for instructions on building 
from source.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Currently we have support for:
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Windows
- Windows CE
- Linux for handhelds (Qtopia)

The specific platforms that have been used for testing are:
- Linux: RedHat 9 on fairly recent Intel hardware
- MacOSX: 10.3
- Windows: Windows 2000 and Windows XP on fairly recent Intel hardware
- Windows CE: PocketPC 2002 on Compaq IPAQ hardware (Strong Arm processors)
- Linux for handhelds: Zaurus (Sharp SL-5600 PDA).

Supported media types
---------------------

- Text is supported on all platforms.
- Images in PNG, JPEG and GIF formats are supported on all
  platforms. Other formats are supported on some platforms.
- Audio:
  - Windows supports audio through DirectX, so all DirectX-compatible
    formats are supported.
  - Windows CE supports only MP3, and cannot mix multiple audio
    streams in this release.
  - MacOSX and Linux support audio through FFMPEG and SDL,
    giving support for MP3 and many other formats, but not
    all codecs may be supported on WMA or QuickTime files.
    Some audio files may be played back at an incorrect sample rate.
- Video:
  - Windows supports video through DirectX.
  - Windows CE does not support video in this release.
  - MacOSX supports video through QuickTime.
  - Linux does not support video in this release.

Networking support
------------------

This release has limited support for networked media. The SMIL
presentation itself must be in a local file, media items can
be retrieved via HTTP or RTP/RTSP on some platforms.

SMIL support
------------

This release supports full SMIL 2.0, with the following broad
exceptions:
- Limited support for internal linking; linking to external HTML sites
  is supported.
- No support for transitions in this release.
- No support for SMIL animation in this release.
- tag names must match media type, and no support for mimetypes

Furthermore, you need to have "expat 1.95.7" installed before
building ambulant; "expat" is used for XML-paring of .smil input files
Previous versions of "expat" will not work with Ambulant.
For more details read the third_party_packages/readme.txt

On Linux, the aRts implementation is currently not working, use
./configure --without-arts --with-ffmpeg[=<your libavcodec>];
make;make install

Documentation
-------------

Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships
can be found in: Documentation/Design in a source distribution.

Examples
--------

Two example SMIL 2.0 documents are included, more are available
at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>. In the binary distributions,
examples are placed in the toplevel distribution directory; in
source distributions, they are in the Extras directory.

The Welcome document is played automatically the very first time you
start the Ambulant Player on MacOSX and can be played manually on other
platforms.

The DemoPresentation document is a slightly more elaborate example with
some variations to show off various features of SMIL, a readme
file is included.

Building from source
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

Obviously you will need a compiler/linker/development environment.
For Windows you need Microsoft Visual Studio .NET version XXXX.
For Linux desktop and MacOSX you need GNU gcc, at least version 3.2.
For Windows CE you need Microsoft Embedded Visual C++ version XXXX.
For Zuarus you need XXXX.

You also need to build and install several third party packages
that Ambulant depends on. All these are supplied in the third_party_packages
directory; see the readme file in that directory for detailed instructions 
on the exact version numbers, download instructions, etc.

These packages can be built from source, but because this may be
difficult on some platforms (especially Windows and the PDA platforms)
we have created archives of pre-configured and pre-built
third_party_packages for a few common platforms. See
<http://www.ambulantplayer.org> or the sourceforge download area for
details.

Building for Linux
------------------

The normal "configure"/"make"/"make install" combo should work.
"
Building for Mac OS X
---------------------

The normal "configure"/"make"/"make install" combo should work.

Building for Windows
--------------------

For Windows, see instructions in bin/win32.

Building for Zaurus

-------------------
For Zaurus, see detailed instructions in README-ZAURUS.

Building for Windows CE
-----------------------

For Windows, see instructions in bin/wince.
