This directory contains version 0.3 of Ambulant,
a playback engine for SMIL documents. 
The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

At the moment ambulant only supports playing back a subset of SMIL,
more-or-less the subset as specified by the 3GPP MMS 2.0 specs
Also, only local media files are supported, no networking yet.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine,
a number of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers,
and a number of player applications.

Currently we have support for:
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Windows
- Zaurus.

Media support is spotty. All platforms support text and images,
but the exact imge file types supported may differ. JPEG is supported
on all platforms, however. Audio is supported on Windows through
the DirectX layer, so any audio file type DirectX supports should work.
On Linux audio playback is supported if you have either SDL or
aRts installed. By themselves these only give you raw audio
playback. To get support for more audio file types you need libffmpeg
installed. On MacOSX audio is only supported if SDL is installed,
and again only raw audio. Whether libffmpeg availability gives
you support for more filetypes is not clear.
In this release we support on MacOSX and on Linux only mp3s of the 
format 22050 Hz mono. 

Documentation of the overall design and the class relationships
can be found in: Documentation/Design. However, some of 

Various example SMIL 2.0 documents can be found in Extras/*.
Not all of them are known to work on all platforms yet.

You need to have "expat 1.95.7" installed before building ambulant;
"expat" is used for XML-paring of .smil input files. Previous
versions of "expat" will not work with ambulant.
For more details read the third_party_packages/readme.txt


A linux GUI player (build with Qt) will be available
in src/player-unix/qt_player.

For MacOSX, the cocoa player only gets built when you do "make install",
it is deposited in /Applications/cocoambulant.app.

For Windows, see instructions in bin/win32.

For Zaurus, see detailed instructions in README-ZAURUS.

Various SMIL 2.0 documents can be found in a seperate repostory ambulant-documents, or as a tar ball at sourceforge.
Note that not all of them are known to work on all platforms yet.
