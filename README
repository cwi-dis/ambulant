This directory contains version 0.2 of Ambulant, a playback engine for
SMIL documents. The ambulant homepage is at <http://www.ambulantplayer.org>.

At the moment ambulant only supports playing back a tiny subset of SMIL,
more-or-less the subset as specified by the 3GPP MMS 2.0 specs.
Also, only local media files are supported, no networking yet.

Ambulant consists of a core library implementing the engine, a number
of GUI-toolkit specific libraries implementing renderers and a number
of player applications. Currently we have support for Qt (on Linux),
Cocoa (on MacOSX) and DirectX (on Windows).

Documentation is sparse, see Documentation/Design for some design
documentation and an overview of the source tree.

Build on Linux/Unix following the detailed instructions in README-CVS.
We need a patched version of expat, follow the instructions to install this in
third_party_packages/readme.txt 
(if you want to try building with standard expat installed on your
system use "configure --with-expat=/usr", but this is lileky to produce
disappointing results).

After building you will find a text-only demo player in Test/designtests/demoplayer.
There is a sample document too, in Test/designtests/mmsdoc/mmsdoc.smil.

A GUI based on QT capable of showing images and text can be found in
src/player-unix/qt_player. It is able to play the sample document mentioned above
(first select the .smil document with "File->Open", then select "Play").

For MacOS, there is a Cocoa player which does not get built with the standard "make",
you need to build it manually with XCode. src/player_macosx/cocoambulant.pbproj
is the project to use. It also plays audio.

For Windows, see the instructions in bin/win32.
