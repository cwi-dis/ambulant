	* RTSP video now works somewhat better, the player doesn't hang
	  anymore.  But the costs are: last video frame is always skipped,
	  and an ugly DummyTask was introduced to get liveMedia out of its
	  select() system call.

2006-11-02 15:35  keesblom

	* Made rtsp mp4 with H263 video and AAC audio work. Apperently, the
	  ffmpeg function avcodec_alloc_context() (which creates an
	  AVCodecContext pointer) initializes the 'channels' field to '1'
	  (Mono) which is not always correct.

2006-11-01 14:34  keesblom

	* Accidently worked on an abandoned branch, merged it back with
	  trunk

2006-10-13 15:47  jackjansen

	* Explicitly call get_url() when converting a url to a string.

2006-10-13 15:46  jackjansen

	* Careful reading of the SMIL spec (by me and Sjoerd) seems to
	  indicate that the set of event names is open-ended in the
	  Language Profile.  Hence, don't check the names, allowing
	  user-defined names (even though the events don't actually do
	  anything).

2006-10-13 15:44  jackjansen

	* Send XML documents to the IE widget.

2006-10-13 15:44  jackjansen

	* Add mimetype application/xml for .xml extension.

2006-10-13 15:43  jackjansen

	* Disabled automatic conversion of url to strings, it masks too
	  many errors.

2006-10-10 17:52  jackjansen

	* Added an add_fragment() method. (The more consistent name add_ref
	  has too many refcounting connotations).

2006-10-10 17:30  keesblom

	* Merged the branch for packet datasouce with trunk

2006-10-05 17:17  jackjansen

	* Somehow the scheduler appears to reuse html widgets on seeking.
	  For now abort the second attempt to play the html (with a
	  message) in stead of crashing the player.

2006-10-02 15:29  jackjansen

	* Sometimes using clipBegin caused quicktime to hang. Created a
	  workaround, but it is not 100% deterministic:-(

2006-09-29 17:08  jackjansen

	* Allow passing "-fullScreen YES" on the command line to open all
	  documents in fullscreen mode.

2006-09-28 16:58  jackjansen

	* Major rewrite of cocoa_video using QTKit in stead of the older
	  NSMovie and NSMovieView classes. This makes things behave a lot
	  better when going to/from fullscreen mode, and also enables
	  future modifications for allowing transitions and overlays on
	  video.

	  Also create the video in the correct size wrt. fit attributes.

2006-09-28 16:56  jackjansen

	* Use applicationWillFinishLaunching in stead of
	  applicationDidFinishLaunching for initialization: this gets the
	  initialization done before the first document is opened when
	  staring by double-clicking a document.

2006-09-25 16:56  keesblom

	* Fixed a core dump on rtsp to a server that is down

2006-09-25 16:52  keesblom

	* Added AM_DBG to a log message

2006-09-22 16:29  keesblom

	* Undo of an undesirable experimental modification accidentally
	  committed

2006-09-22 12:56  jackjansen

	* - ppc builds on intel now work too.  - cleanup.

2006-09-22 11:15  jackjansen

	* Merging branch exp-jack-osx-universal: enable building universal
	  binaries on MacOSX. The procedure is still a bit shakey, but at
	  least it is documented (in src/player_macosx/README and
	  third_party_packages/readme-osx.txt).

2006-09-21 16:56  keesblom

	* #1562153 (deadly embrace on Windows) solved by moving a call to
	  destroy_playables out of the area protected by m_playables_cs.

2006-09-21 16:42  keesblom

	* Made firefox plugin window  specific s.t. each firefox window
	  gets its own plugin, irs own playabl, etc.

2006-09-21 12:58  keesblom

	* Adapted firefox plugin s.t. it "works" again with embedded
	  scriptable controls (known limitations: one url only, firefox may
	  crash when opening another file)

2006-09-19 15:32  keesblom

	* Repaired net/datasource.cpp s.t. it also works on Linux.  Tagged
	  the trunk "release-ambulant-18-merge-trunk-1".  Previous tags
	  "release-ambulant-18-merge" and "release-ambulant-18-merge-trunk"
	  are meaningless (not to be used).

2006-09-18 13:39  p_cesar

	* typo error

2006-09-18 13:38  p_cesar

	* libtool instructions for mac

2006-09-16 00:22  jackjansen

	* Added a call to set global audio playback volume.

	  At the moment this is not honoured directly, but only as soon as
	  new items are played (or other volume control happens), that may
	  need to be changed.

2006-09-15 17:23  jackjansen

	* Don't do node_started() callbacks to the embedding application
	  while fast-forwarding.

2006-09-15 11:44  jackjansen

	* When starting a document with goto_node be sure to also start the
	  update() callback.

2006-09-15 00:04  jackjansen

	* A fix that I'm not 100% sure of (i.e. needs to be tested): when
	  playing blabla.smil#node, don't first call start() but call
	  goto_node() straight away (as it will implicitly start the
	  document).

	  But it seems the Windows player can hang, sometimes?

2006-09-14 23:57  jackjansen

	* Added various calls to started().

2006-09-14 23:56  jackjansen

	* Fixed off-by-one error in splitting path#frag for Windows
	  filenames.

2006-09-14 22:45  jackjansen

	* Call setLoadExternalDTD(false), otherwise the Xerces parser will
	  still do some (minimal) network traffic even when validate=never.
	  This causes a stall when not connected to the net, or even a
	  parse error if www.w3.org isn't in the NS cache.

2006-09-08 15:52  keesblom

	* Updated TIPS-NOKIA770 for the 2006 Software Edition

2006-09-08 15:05  keesblom

	* Updated version number to 1.8

2006-09-08 13:43  keesblom

	* Updated version number to 1.8 in the XP installer

2006-09-08 13:39  keesblom

	* Made qt_html_renderer compile agian

2006-09-08 11:57  jackjansen

	* 1.8 icons.

2006-09-08 11:49  jackjansen

	* Icon for 1.8

2006-09-08 09:30  jackjansen

	* Put digits in separate layer.

2006-09-06 17:01  keesblom

	* Preparing for distribution: added missing finction
	  html_browser_imp::uses_screen_reader()

2006-09-06 00:45  jackjansen

	* More news.

2006-09-06 00:20  jackjansen

	* Started on updating the readme's.

2006-09-05 23:47  jackjansen

	* Python-Qt based example player works!

2006-09-05 15:21  keesblom

	* Added AM_DBG for debug messages generated for each video frame

2006-09-05 13:15  keesblom

	* #define AM_DBG turned off

2006-09-05 11:10  keesblom

	* Update preparing for 1.8 release

2006-09-04 17:43  jackjansen

	* Don't schedule out transitions when fast-forwarding a node.

	  Fixes #1501707.

2006-09-04 16:54  keesblom

	* Eliminated potential crash by suppressing unnessary calls to
	  stopped()

2006-08-30 14:50  keesblom

	* Reset the multiple calls to gst_element_set_state() back because
	  it seems less stable without them. The succesive states were
	  found on Nokia770 using: gst-launch-0.10 gnomevfssrc
	  location=<filename> ! dspmp3sink

2006-08-30 11:01  keesblom

	* Removed some superfluous(?) calls to gst_element_set_state()
	  According to gstreamer documentation, all intermediate state
	  changes are done automatically by gstreamer

2006-08-29 16:25  keesblom

	* Made the Menu items Help->AmbulantPlayer Help/Website work using
	  some suitable commands on the dbus.

2006-08-29 14:47  keesblom

	* Omitted extra qualifier to get gcc satisfied

2006-08-29 10:05  keesblom

	* AmbulantPlayer now installs and plays on Nokia withour problems.

2006-08-24 16:47  jackjansen

	* Allow for HTML to be timed, for example when it has to go to a
	  text-to-speech engine.

2006-08-24 16:46  jackjansen

	* The document class needs the Win32 export mumbo-jumbo.

2006-08-24 16:46  jackjansen

	* del_attribute() modified the attribute list while iterating over
	  it. Fixed.

2006-08-24 16:45  jackjansen

	* - Special treatment of discrete nodes wrt. timing calculations is
	  not only   against the SMIL spec, but also turned out to be a
	  problem for Amis,   where text nodes may need to be rendered
	  through a speech synth.    WARNING: this fix may cause documents
	  to hang, if there are renderers    that do not call
	  context->stopped().  - node_started callbacks were given a bit
	  late. Fixed.

2006-08-23 16:41  keesblom

	* Some more cleanup

2006-08-23 15:01  keesblom

	* Some cleanup as suggested by valgrind

2006-08-22 17:40  jackjansen

	* A few more minor fixes to the mass factory checkin.

2006-08-22 17:32  jackjansen

	* Forgt another file.

2006-08-22 17:31  keesblom

	* Small fix to make it compile again

2006-08-22 17:04  keesblom

	* Small fix to make it compile again

2006-08-22 16:43  ishanvaishnavi

	* dded framerate to video_datasource. Added some jitter handling
	  capability. Ishan

2006-08-22 16:40  ishanvaishnavi

	* Added framerate function to video_datasource class. Added some
	  capability for jitter related issues. Ishan

2006-08-22 16:08  jackjansen

	* Forgot to add this file.

2006-08-22 16:00  jackjansen

	* Mass checkin: added factory functions for all factories. This
	  allows use to hide the factory classes, which in turn means you
	  don't need to include any cruft (such as SDL headers when you
	  only need the SDL factory).

2006-08-22 14:02  jackjansen

	* Builds both with and without QT support.

2006-08-22 13:37  jackjansen

	* Various third party libraries were included notonly when linking
	  libambulant, but also libambulant_qt and such. This not only made
	  the libraries huge, but also caused problems for the python
	  plugin.

2006-08-22 10:59  jackjansen

	* QWidget definition guard changed.

2006-08-21 17:49  jackjansen

	* Exported the newly available qt factory functionality to Python.

2006-08-21 17:28  jackjansen

	* Split implementation details out of qt_factory.h and moved them
	  to qt_factory_impl.h.

2006-08-21 15:05  keesblom

	* mp3 audio on Nokia 770 doesn't crash any more (well... I hope
	  so).	m_gst_player_mutex was added to protect the gstreamer
	  player.  All extern "C" { code } was recodeed into C++.  Usage of
	  "#ifdef NOKIA770" was minimized.

2006-08-21 14:32  ishanvaishnavi

	* Added mpeg2 support. Works now slightly flickery. Ishan.

2006-08-21 14:31  ishanvaishnavi

	* Added frame alignment. Mpeg2 video works now but is slightly
	  flickery (late frames ?). Ishan

2006-08-18 17:18  jackjansen

	* Adapted for changes to factory.

2006-08-18 16:18  jackjansen

	* Adapted for changes in factory.

2006-08-18 15:43  jackjansen

	* Fixed factory objects to be more Python-compatible: a couple of
	  methods needed to be virtual (so they can be overridden in
	  python) and instance variables need to be private.

2006-08-18 15:30  jackjansen

	* Works using the none_gui windows and playables.

2006-08-17 17:29  ishanvaishnavi

	* Called tearDownSession to cleanly exit.Ishan

2006-08-17 17:03  jackjansen

	* Got started on some instructions.

2006-08-17 16:44  keesblom

	* Restructured code a little bit to despaghettize the locking
	  mechanism Nokia770 still dumps core, but maybe not because of
	  gstreamer_player, but because of bugs in drawing code: stack
	  backtraces suggest so.

2006-08-17 16:41  ishanvaishnavi

	* Freed memory which I forgot in my last check in. Ishan.

2006-08-17 16:36  ishanvaishnavi

	* Fixed typo.

2006-08-17 16:18  jackjansen

	* Started on the Python example program: a minimal Qt player.  At
	  the moment it's a boilerplate Qt app.

2006-08-17 15:07  ishanvaishnavi

	* Added Mpeg4 support for RTSP. Ishan.

2006-08-17 11:55  jackjansen

	* Minor mods to make qt-player work (after some hacking) with Mac
	  Qt.

2006-08-16 23:22  jackjansen

	* The code for handling file: urls had become badly broken by fix
	  upon fix.  It couldn't handle URLs for files with spaces in the
	  name anymore, such as the Welcome document:-)

	  Fixed, but I'm not 100% sure I didn't break anything else...

2006-08-15 17:09  jackjansen

	* Got rid of some unneeded copying and other dead wood.

2006-08-15 17:06  jackjansen

	* Got rid of debug image dumping code.

2006-08-15 15:59  keesblom

	* Attempt to satisfy valgrind somewhet

2006-08-15 15:57  keesblom

	* Caught a crash on 770 by running valgrind using gstreamer-0.10 on
	  FC 5

2006-08-15 15:54  keesblom

	* dapted for gcc 4.1 used on Fedora Core 5

2006-08-15 14:05  jackjansen

	* Finished documentation for 1.8 (I think).

2006-08-14 17:44  jackjansen

	* More documentation fixes.

2006-08-14 16:06  jackjansen

	* More bits of documentation updated.

2006-08-14 16:04  jackjansen

	* Unsure (fix was sitting on my disk): may have to do with filename
	  escaping on MacOS.

2006-08-14 00:11  jackjansen

	* Started on fixing API documentation.

2006-08-13 20:56  keesblom

	* gstreamer audio on Nokia 770 now dosn't hnag, but crashes after
	  some time.

2006-08-10 13:30  jackjansen

	* Don't use strdup(), wince doesn't like it.

2006-08-10 13:23  jackjansen

	* Got rid of USE_SMIL21.

2006-08-10 13:23  jackjansen

	* Some pathnames got corrupted. Fixed.

2006-08-10 11:32  jackjansen

	* Got rid of USE_SMIL21.

2006-08-10 00:09  jackjansen

	* Getting rid of USE_SMIL21

2006-08-09 23:59  jackjansen

	* Getting rid of entries for SMIL 2.1 in WD, CR, PR and RC forms,
	  which are no longer relevant.

2006-08-09 23:56  jackjansen

	* Mass commit: getting rid of USE_SMIL21, which is now always on.

	  Compiles on Mac, but that's about all that has been tested so
	  far.

2006-08-07 13:28  keesblom

	* Adapted to gstreamer-0.10.

2006-08-07 12:10  keesblom

	* Adapted to gstreamer-0.10. Do not use this version, ist is not
	  yet tested.

2006-08-04 13:32  keesblom

	* Ported to Maemo 2.0 (PC version). It seems that the system takes
	  care of removing the logger window on exit.

2006-08-02 17:08  keesblom

	* Implemented video transitions for qt and gtk.  Continued bug hunt
	  why the player hangs skppin videos in Flashlight.

2006-07-27 14:35  keesblom

	* Implemented triangle, arrowhead, pentagon and hexagon wipes for
	  Windows XP. The state of in-transition implementation  for
	  Windows XP is now the same as for the other platforms (no
	  subtypes, for each class at least one transition type
	  implemented).

2006-07-27 14:07  keesblom

	* Implemented bowTieWipe for Windows XP.

2006-07-27 11:59  keesblom

	* Implemented irisWipe (which is a required type) for Windows XP.
	  Also repaired a problem appearing in Windows XP with
	  diagonalWipe: m_newpolygon was computed corretcly but not cleared
	  between transition steps. This was not observed on other
	  platforms because of winding rule parameter selection.

2006-07-19 11:19  jackjansen

	* html widget was always created at topleft of the window. Fixed.

2006-07-18 17:07  keesblom

	* data:, URL proiduced error message, although it did work, except
	  on Window when > c16 chars, because the std::string returned by
	  url.get_url() was already reclaimed before an allocated copy was
	  made

2006-07-18 14:11  keesblom

	* Modified dx implementation of r1r2r3r4 transitions
	  (push,slide)Wipe s.t. these more or less work the same way as
	  qt/gtk players do.  Note that they are all wrong because they
	  transition the whole region in which the media is rendered, not
	  the subregion occupied by the media. This holds for all
	  transition types, see EUROshow.smil when EURO 50 image is
	  rendered.

2006-07-18 13:54  keesblom

	* Removed warning that polylist was not tested

2006-07-18 11:12  jackjansen

	* Build shared library builds with xerces builtin, no expat. This
	  is a stopgap to get AmisAmbulant to work better.

2006-07-18 11:12  jackjansen

	* Builds without USE_SMIL21 were broken. Fixed.

2006-07-18 10:49  jackjansen

	* Allow for builds with WITH_XERCES_BUILTIN and without WITH_EXPAT,
	  they will use xerces as the default parser.

2006-07-18 10:48  jackjansen

	* Added a flag to url::from_filename() that allows honoring of
	  #fragment.

2006-07-10 15:31  keesblom

	* Added a call to pthread_mutex_lock() in
	  gtk_gui::do_internal_message() to prevent multiple threads
	  simultaneously access the logger buffer, and crash with a cryptic
	  error message. This happened often in the logger when AM_DBG was
	  enabled.  Although far less frequently, alas! this still happens
	  now and then and I can't understand why: the call to
	  pthread_mutex_lock() is checked for errors and these are not
	  reported when the crash happens.

2006-07-10 09:47  jackjansen

	* Fixes for document_loaded()

2006-07-10 01:49  jackjansen

	* Added a document_loaded() callback that is called after the tree
	  has been read but before the timegraph is created. Embedding apps
	  can use this to modify the tree.

	  For this reason, player::initialize() is always used (not only
	  when USE_SMIL21 is defined) and does most of the work the
	  constructor used to do. If the embedder wants the
	  document_loaded() callback it should call set_embedder() before
	  initialize().

	  Mods	untested for Windows/Linux.

2006-07-07 18:13  keesblom

	* Re-arranged call to gdk_pixbuf_loader_close() to handle small
	  images correctly

2006-07-07 16:00  keesblom

	* Started on creating a list of tests to be done before a
	  distribution.  These tests are supposed to be done on all
	  supported platforms, for the stand-alone players and the browser
	  plugins, when applicable.  Also a list of missing tests and known
	  unimplemented features is added.

2006-07-06 16:22  keesblom

	* Added some debug messages to hunt the Flashlight bug

2006-07-04 16:02  keesblom

	* Reload didn't work properly: it never(gtk) or often(qt) reparsed
	  the document

2006-07-04 15:18  keesblom

	* Renamed the Linux players to AmbulantPlayer_gtk and
	  AmbulantPlayer_qt.  For the time being, "make install" also adds
	  the link AmbulantPlayer to AmbulantPlayer_qt to achieve
	  compatability.  AM_DBG was commented out in ffmpeg*.cpp,
	  otherwise player crashes.

2006-07-03 14:34  keesblom

	* Merging gtk transitions with trunk

2006-07-01 00:18  jackjansen

	* Handle #frag for unknown protocols. Not 100% sure this is a good
	  idea, but it's needed for AmisAmbulant.

2006-06-30 10:41  jackjansen

	* Squashed Windows warnings about dll-enabled classes that contain
	  non-dll-enabled objects. Don't like this, but the workaround is
	  severe.

2006-06-27 13:40  p_cesar

	* get screenshot done

2006-06-26 16:54  ishanvaishnavi

	* Added new audio codec for dynamic RTP stream. ffmpeg doesn't seem
	  to have support for this yet.

2006-06-26 15:49  ishanvaishnavi

	* hanged to support live. Should work now!

2006-06-23 18:06  ishanvaishnavi

	* Trying to add support for audio via viewing a RTSP video stream.
	  This code wasn't written completely before. This change is not
	  complete. But it makes the audio work for atleast mpeg2 video
	  streams.

2006-06-23 16:38  jackjansen

	* pause() method had the wrong signature so it was never called.
	  Fixed.

2006-06-23 13:27  keesblom

	* Bug#1505278 revisited: media do not play when local path on
	  commandline now solved in gui_player.cpp instead of the platform
	  specific players

2006-06-22 16:19  jackjansen

	* context->nstreams was used for two distinct things: counting the
	  number One variable was used for botgh counting the number of
	  streams and the number of active streams. fixed.

2006-06-22 16:13  keesblom

	* Fixed bug#1505278 by making the path absolute in openSMILfile.
	  In both qt_gui and gtk_gui,m_smilfilename is now a dynamic data
	  structure

2006-06-22 12:10  jackjansen

	* Disabled more debugging.

2006-06-21 14:31  keesblom

	* Turned off AM_DBG debugging flag

2006-06-21 14:26  keesblom

	* Solved bug#1508660: the motion_notify_event was connected to the
	  toplevel widget, but in the destructor an attempt was done to
	  remove it from a lower level widget, which failed.

2006-06-20 15:14  jackjansen

	* Disabling debug prints and other details.

2006-06-20 15:12  jackjansen

	* Found and fixed the last problem that caused navigation not to
	  work on Windows: the renderers didn't all call context->stopped()
	  on a call to stop(). Fixed.

2006-06-20 13:26  keesblom

	* More detailed instructions how to create a installable debian
	  package,

2006-06-20 12:57  jackjansen

	* Details.

2006-06-19 18:03  jackjansen

	* Accidentally commented out killing of playables during ffwd.
	  Fixed.

2006-06-19 16:05  jackjansen

	* Brought over some of the multi-threading fixes from AmisAmbulant.

2006-06-19 16:04  jackjansen

	* Don't crash when trying to view source on remote document. In
	  stead, give an error message:-)

2006-06-19 14:52  jackjansen

	* - Continuous media duration was always ignored (in stead of only
	  while fast-forwarding). Fixed.  - Fixed some debug output.

2006-06-19 14:03  keesblom

	* Added an explicit test for pkg-config, otherwise in the configure
	  script the PKG_CONFIG variable doesn't get properly initialized
	  when the first occurence of the PKG_CHECK_MODULES in configure.in
	  is inside a conditional section (--with-qt) and the condition is
	  false (--without-qt)

2006-06-16 12:46  keesblom

	* With --without-qt explicitly set do not try to use QTDIR
	  environment variable

2006-06-14 16:58  keesblom

	* Reorganized memory management for qt internal messages

2006-06-14 15:38  keesblom

	* AM_DBG turned off

2006-06-14 15:30  keesblom

	* Made "Reload" work with GTK and Qt

2006-06-12 11:54  jackjansen

	* Give fatal error message if the (shared) library is configured
	  for HTML support but the main program is not.

2006-06-12 11:54  jackjansen

	* Various build settings were incorrect for DebugShlib.

2006-06-12 10:17  jackjansen

	* Details.

2006-06-10 23:12  jackjansen

	* More aggressive fix, which seems to work for Daisy books: when
	  setting a node to fast-forward mode also do this to the
	  descendent nodes. In addition, for playable nodes also kill the
	  playable, if it exists.

	  Not sure whether SMIL semantics haven't completely gone out the
	  window, though...

2006-06-10 22:55  jackjansen

	* - Added various debug statements to the fast-forward code.  -
	  Fixed one bug: when fast-forwarding, ignore duration of
	  continuous-media children   when determining whether a time
	  container can finish.

	  Unfortunately this fix is (a) not necessarily correct and (b)
	  good enough for my test document but not for real Daisy books:-(

2006-06-09 17:25  jackjansen

	* The scheduler didn't lock anything, but at the same time it
	  appears to be non-reentrant. Fixed this by adding a real lock,
	  plus a warning message whenever a potential deadlock is detected.

	  Also undid the 1.10 change, but I'm not sure this makes much of a
	  difference.

2006-06-09 14:52  jackjansen

	* - Minor changes to rtsp handling (incomplete) - Additions to the
	  scheduler to facilitate debugging - Unknown changes to the
	  project.

2006-06-07 15:07  ishanvaishnavi

	* Modified so that it compile with gcc 4.1.  Ishan

2006-06-07 13:12  keesblom

	* little optimization in show_frame()

2006-06-06 14:35  keesblom

	* Added locking in gtk_video_renderer::redraw() as well with a
	  comment: locking at this point may result in deadly embrace with
	  internal lock but as far as we know this has never happened

2006-06-06 14:16  keesblom

	* Added a lock in qt_video_renderer::redraw() to prevent
	  segmentation violations

2006-06-02 16:12  keesblom

	* Implemented Arrow/Hand cursors for gtk. Cursors are cached by
	  gtk_window_factory

2006-06-01 15:35  keesblom

	* Got rid of an ugly cast by re-defining qt_mainloop() constructor
	  as suggested by Jack

2006-06-01 15:05  keesblom

	* Made Play-Pause-Stop work for player_gtk

2006-05-31 15:47  jackjansen

	* Added interface to allow plugins to export a data structure to
	  Ambulant.  Added a call to plugin_engine that allows ambulant
	  plugins or embedders to obtain a pointer to this data structure
	  for a given, named plugin.

2006-05-30 16:39  keesblom

	* Repaired PointingHand cursor by remembering qt_mainloop* as
	  m_gui-player

2006-05-30 15:47  keesblom

	* Added new files to the documentation

2006-05-30 10:46  keesblom

	* Adapted PATH to reflect that on apps.cwi.nl 'rsync' is stored in
	  a weird place

2006-05-24 15:15  jackjansen

	* ReleaseShlib was missing HTML widget.  Enabled goto-node code.

2006-05-24 14:49  keesblom

	* Added backup script adapted to the new sourgeforge 'rsync' only
	  policy

2006-05-22 14:17  keesblom

	* Update for Nokia 770. Occasional deadlock when opening new file
	  persists.

2006-05-19 16:55  marisademeglio

	* small bug fix regarding guesstype()

2006-05-17 16:37  keesblom

	* Added some tips for software development on the Nokia 770
	  (networking, debugging)

2006-05-17 15:08  keesblom

	* Turned off debugging

2006-05-17 15:05  keesblom

	* Added a global lock for the Nokia 770 s.t. the DSP processor will
	  only be accessed by one thread at a time (audio must have
	  released hardware before next audio can be initiated).

2006-05-17 14:27  jackjansen

	* Minor fixes for handling urls with #fragment

2006-05-16 11:42  jackjansen

	* Got rid of the bug-workaround for amis-ambulant hanging on close,
	  the problem has been fixed in amis.

2006-05-01 17:25  jackjansen

	* Pass the datasource factory to html_bridge::goto_url, so the
	  implementation can choose to use ambulant datasources to load the
	  html data.

2006-05-01 14:07  jackjansen

	* If _DEBUG is defined, set the default default loglevel to debug.

2006-05-01 12:10  jackjansen

	* Get puglins to link on Windows. Untested.

2006-04-27 23:52  jackjansen

	* Make sure xerces_parser.cpp and expat_parser.cpp are included in
	  a source distribution.

2006-04-27 23:48  jackjansen

	* Added a note about testing the source distribution on Windows.
	  Added a note about testing the OSX distribution on older
	  releases.

2006-04-27 16:31  jackjansen

	* Added a couple more AMBULANTAPI flags.

2006-04-27 16:31  jackjansen

	* Temporary patch to forestall AmisAmbulant deadlock: hide HTML
	  window in-line in stead of scheduling a callback.

2006-04-27 15:21  jackjansen

	* Two files were missing from source distributions, added.

	  Need to backport.

2006-04-26 14:59  jackjansen

	* Got plugins to work also for ReleaseShLib build.

2006-04-26 14:58  jackjansen

	* More deadlocks.

2006-04-26 14:50  keesblom

	* Solved bug when selecting a second file: some callback functions
	  could become active with pointers to removed windows

2006-04-26 10:17  jackjansen

	* sigh, more locking had to be commented out because of deadlocks.

2006-04-24 16:42  jackjansen

	* Got plugins to actually work on Windows again (in a Shlib build).

	  Added a project to the solution that builds the default dummy
	  plugin if we're doing a DebugShlib build.

2006-04-24 15:08  jackjansen

	* Windows plugin support had experienced bitrot over the last
	  months.  Started on fixing it.

	  Also added the plugin uptions to the preferecnes dialog (disabled
	  if plugin support not configured).

2006-04-24 14:55  keesblom

	* More leaks. AmbulantPlayer now playes NewYork on Nokia770
	  fluently without oops.

2006-04-21 16:51  jackjansen

	* Added raw_filter datasources: a datasource that filters data
	  coming from another datasource (for things such as compression or
	  encryption).	Also added a base class for such filters that does
	  most of the administrative work, and an example filter that does
	  rot13 decoding (if the URL ends in .rot13).

2006-04-21 16:00  keesblom

	* More cleanup, commandline args do not work yet, but at least
	  gtk_player doesn't crash

2006-04-21 12:51  keesblom

	* More cleanup, no more Megabytes definitely lost by
	  gtk_image_renderer

2006-04-21 00:21  jackjansen

	* added a test to check that (at least the stdio) datasource works.

2006-04-20 23:56  jackjansen

	* Regenerated without the tp_init calls to the baseclass tp_init.

2006-04-20 23:56  jackjansen

	* Python re-implementations should inherit from the abstract
	  baseclass which they implement.

2006-04-20 17:10  keesblom

	* More cleanup

2006-04-20 16:58  jackjansen

	* AMBULANTAPI is now also used after class sometimes.

2006-04-20 00:08  jackjansen

	* Const in argument dictionaries seems to have disappeared for
	  Python 2.5a1.

2006-04-19 17:08  keesblom

	* Changed image drawing code to get rid of vague images and memory
	  leakes

2006-04-18 15:58  jackjansen

	* std::string could be deleted while the c_str() was still in use.
	  Fixed.

2006-04-13 16:53  keesblom

	* Merged gstreamer branch (audio for Nokia 770) with trunk

2006-04-13 16:45  jackjansen

	* More changes for amis-ambulant integration.

2006-04-12 17:19  jackjansen

	* - Revamped html_browser interface organisation so it can be used
	  in a setting where Ambulant is in a DLL.  - Added various
	  AMBULANTAPI keywords, for using Ambulant in a DLL - Got DLL
	  version of Ambulant to work again.  - Added a couple of methods
	  tha Amis need to url.

2006-04-12 00:07  jackjansen

	* If ffmpeg could open the file but not parse the input format it
	  would leave the AVCodecContext in a partially initialized state.
	  Fixed.  Partial fix for #1437821 (fixes the crash, but still no
	  OggVorbis support).

	  The AVCodecContext object was never freed. Fixed.

2006-04-09 01:12  jackjansen

	* prepare_playables() did some pretty aggressive preloading of
	  playables. This creates problems with long sequences. Disabled
	  the code for the time being.

	  Fixes #1079413.

2006-04-07 16:03  p_cesar

	* no more debug

2006-04-07 15:47  p_cesar

	* gtk_factory is clean up.

	  Still:  - Overlay images are not supported  - Full screen mode is
	  not working  - icons (stop/play) are not implemented

2006-04-06 16:44  jackjansen

	* Enabled node::get_children() for Python nodes with a trick: use
	  the C++ node_navigator. A bit of a hack, but it works.

2006-04-06 15:02  jackjansen

	* More fixes for pause_display

2006-04-06 11:44  jackjansen

	* Added support for pause_display.

2006-04-06 11:39  jackjansen

	* More changes because of implementation of pause_display.

2006-04-05 23:53  jackjansen

	* Mass checkin: enable pause show/hide semantics by adding an
	  optional parameter to playable::pause(). Currently implemented
	  only for the Quicktime video renderer, but most other renderers
	  already accidentally have the right behaviour for 90% of the
	  documents.

	  Needs work on Linux and Windows.

2006-04-05 23:51  jackjansen

	* Better handling of video files that have an audio stream that is
	  recognized but for which no codec is available.

2006-04-05 23:50  jackjansen

	* Enable fullscreen mode on secondary screen(s) too. Fixes
	  #1459157.

2006-04-05 15:06  jackjansen

	* Temporarily disable hand cursor.

2006-03-28 14:13  jackjansen

	* The unicode-based release build had gotten rather broken after a
	  long time of using only the mbcs-based debug build. Fixed it, and
	  also set the debug build to use unicode so this shouldn't happen
	  again in future.

2006-03-27 14:05  jackjansen

	* Implemented navigation with TAB and RETURN.

2006-03-27 13:11  jackjansen

	* Implemented something resembling fullscreen mode. Still has some
	  problems, though: - The taskbar doesn't disappear - The content
	  is topleft, and I can't seem to center it.

2006-03-27 10:18  jackjansen

	* Machine-independent impleentation of memfile using datasources,
	  replacing win32-specific one.

2006-03-24 16:41  jackjansen

	* Minor fix to make things compile for WinCE.

2006-03-24 15:51  jackjansen

	* Show link destination and some other interesting information in
	  the status line at the bottom of the window.

2006-03-23 16:52  jackjansen

	* Added glue code to enable setting the status line.

2006-03-23 16:14  jackjansen

	* Adapted to new before_mousemove()/after_mousemove() API.

2006-03-23 15:25  jackjansen

	* Serious reorganisation: - Group methods by class - Within a
	  class, group them by function - fixed indentation - rationalized
	  a couple of defines - rationalized some code too

2006-03-23 14:46  jackjansen

	* Updated python interfaces.

2006-03-23 14:23  jackjansen

	* Temporarily disabled mouseMoved handling to make Qt player work
	  again.

2006-03-23 13:18  jackjansen

	* Revamped mouseOver handling. The GUI first calls
	  before_mousemoved(), then passes the event to the layout
	  structures (which call pointed() for each active region
	  containing the mouse), then calls after_mousemoved() which can
	  now correctly compute which nodes have obtained focus anew, or
	  lost focus.  This gets rid of lots and lots of spurious inBounds,
	  focusIn, outOfBounds and focusOutEvents, and makes the hand
	  cursor behave more predictable too.

	  Only tested on mac, so far.

2006-03-20 11:37  jackjansen

	* Got rid of a few leaks.

2006-03-20 00:02  jackjansen

	* Added a method get_default_size() to window_factory. This allows
	  auxiliary presentations to use the size of the main presentation
	  by simply not specifying a root-layout size. It should even allow
	  centering and such, I hope.

2006-03-17 14:15  jackjansen

	* Auxiliary document is starting to work, somewhat.

2006-03-17 13:39  jackjansen

	* Attempting to delete a thread before it had actually started
	  caused a crash.  Fixed.

2006-03-17 00:33  jackjansen

	* Aux_open() wasn't virtual (sigh), fixed.

2006-03-16 17:03  jackjansen

	* Started on experimental support for playing a second (control)
	  presentation on top of the first one. Does not work yet, but
	  neither does it appear to break anything:-)

2006-03-16 00:09  jackjansen

	* - Added better handling for URLs with unknown schemes.  - Better
	  error message in case of linking to an external document that
	  does not exist.

2006-03-15 23:25  jackjansen

	* Fixed various error messages.

2006-03-15 23:25  jackjansen

	* Fixed a rare race condition (resulting in a hang) during cleanup.

2006-03-15 13:34  jackjansen

	* MouseMoved events also work in fullscreen mode.

2006-03-15 13:31  jackjansen

	* Got fullscreen input to work. Changing the mouse cursor over
	  links does not work yet, that will have to wait.

2006-03-15 11:46  jackjansen

	* Fullscreen mode works, but no input yet.

2006-03-15 00:23  jackjansen

	* Started on fullscreen view. Partially working.

2006-03-14 22:44  jackjansen

	* Always return absolute paths from get_local_datafile().

2006-03-14 16:56  jackjansen

	* Fixed some tab/space confusion.

2006-03-14 16:47  jackjansen

	* Sanity checks

2006-03-14 16:13  jackjansen

	* Rationalized code quite a bit, removed unused stuff.

2006-03-14 15:26  jackjansen

	* Getting rid of debug output made gtk video renderer work.

2006-03-14 14:44  jackjansen

	* Qt didn't include ffmpeg video. Fixed.

2006-03-13 17:40  jackjansen

	* Fixed ffmpeg video timing. Main problem was the use of two
	  distinct timers in video_renderer and ffmpeg_video_datasource,
	  with deltas from the one being used to calculate delays for the
	  other. Also fixed a few minor issues.

2006-03-10 18:11  jackjansen

	* added a del_attribute() method to nodes.

2006-03-10 16:22  jackjansen

	* Also allow goto_node() while the document is playing.

2006-03-09 16:47  jackjansen

	* - Got rid of xerces and live for the annotator project (they were
	  causing problems on the intel mac that I don't want to bother
	  with right now).  - Added pause/resume to the quicktime video
	  renderer.

2006-03-06 14:15  jackjansen

	* Added dummy highlight() method.

2006-03-06 11:18  jackjansen

	* Added dummy highlight methods.

2006-03-06 09:03  jackjansen

	* Implemented highlighting (embedder can highlight nodes) and,
	  while I was at it, using tab/return to navigate over anchors and
	  hyperlinks and follow them. Only tested on Mac, so far.

2006-02-28 00:25  jackjansen

	* - Added node_focussed call to player_feedback. This is called by
	  the player   when a node is hovered over.  - Used this
	  functionality in the Mac player to add a status bar that lists
	  the url a click will send you to.

2006-02-27 17:14  p_cesar

	* [no log message]

2006-02-24 17:59  jackjansen

	* Implemented accesskey on anchors, by keeping a mapping of
	  char->node id and simulating a click when the char is typed.

2006-02-24 17:53  p_cesar

	* Images, Images generated by pen, text works in the annotator
	  audio is missing

2006-02-24 16:59  jackjansen

	* Started on implementing accesskey. Works on the mac, and only for
	  events.

2006-02-23 18:53  p_cesar

	* add image from URL

2006-02-23 16:16  jackjansen

	* Define AMBULANT_PLUGINDIR on the command line, so the plugin
	  loader can also locate the correct directory if our $prefix isn't
	  /usr/local.  Should fix #1396102.

2006-02-23 14:41  jackjansen

	* Change build order for plugins and python module, so build with
	  python plugin can happen in one go.

2006-02-23 14:40  jackjansen

	* Fixed typo in the test for Mac framework Python.

2006-02-22 17:43  p_cesar

	* GTK Ambulant Annotator Server side:	it plays, stop, pause, get
	  document, and get screenshot GTK Core Architecture:  mainloop
	  creates a gtk_ambulant_widget  it initializes the window_factory
	  with that widget	The window_factory creates an
	  ambulant_gtk_widget	    This way, we have control from the
	  mainloop over the    actual GTK widget (rendering area or
	  documentcontainer)	     in order to get screenshots

2006-02-21 18:31  p_cesar

	* First trial to get screenshot from GTK player

2006-02-21 16:41  jackjansen

	* Reorganized to make autogen.sh work again.

2006-02-21 16:41  jackjansen

	* ffmpeg configuration had stupid bug when looking for slurped
	  ffmpeg-cvs. Fixed.

2006-02-21 14:19  jackjansen

	* GTK player works again.

2006-02-17 14:19  jackjansen

	* More bits and pieces of getting gtk_player and qt_player back in
	  shape.

	  qt_player should work, gtk_player is still broken.

2006-02-16 17:08  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-playerobj branch: - Moved lots of functionality
	  from the various mainloop objects to a   common baseclass
	  gui_player.  - Added support for plugins written in Python.  -
	  Tweaked many interfaces to allow better access from Python.

	  This checkin may well break builds for a few days.

2006-02-15 18:18  p_cesar

	* I think the problem with the reload function is because the
	  GtkDrawingArea created in
	  gtk_ambulant_widget::gtk_ambulant_widget is never removed from
	  the container.  Solutions:	   1. gtk_gui is in charge of
	  creating the GtkDrawingArea  2. when the widget is not needed, it
	  has to be removed from the container and free

2006-02-15 15:34  keesblom

	* Added support for Nokia 770 Internet Tablet.	It compiles in the
	  Scratchbox environment for Maemo after: configure --with-gtk
	  --with-nokia770 and using: dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot a
	  downloadble debian package will be created:
	  ../ambulantplayer-app_0.2_arm.deb

2006-02-15 15:08  p_cesar

	*
	   no more gtk_C_callback_helper_queue_draw_area message

2006-02-15 11:18  p_cesar

	* gtk_gui and gtk_factory do not print any debug information

2006-02-15 11:09  p_cesar

	* gtk_player does not need of the ui xml file

2006-02-14 16:06  p_cesar

	* Modified delete/free error in gtk_logger (m_logger_window)
	  Modified delete/free error in gtk_factory (m_pixmap)

	  The problem with the video happens as well in QT version...
	  (maybe ffmpeg?)

2006-02-13 17:49  p_cesar

	* Several trials with g_thread and add_idle still video is not
	  working properly

2006-02-10 17:08  p_cesar

	* Several tries, video is not ready yet

2006-02-07 14:37  p_cesar

	* User events work.  Current problems:	- the player crashes when
	  reloading/stopping a presentation	- videos are played, but
	  skipping too many frames	 - the size of the main window has
	  to take into account the GUI size (when resizing and when
	  handling events)    - The GUI expects an exact location of the
	  XML file

	  Current features	  - Images/text/fill/video support	  -
	  User events (mouse)	- GUI

	  Next:   - solve the mentioned bugs	  - start the develpoment
	  of the cairo renderer (including a transparent conatiner in which
	  to place SVG ink strokes)

2006-02-07 12:10  p_cesar

	* Resize functionality

2006-02-07 10:02  p_cesar

	* Video works (but, it skips many frames.... ??)

2006-02-06 16:31  p_cesar

	* More debug printings unset

2006-02-06 16:28  p_cesar

	* Debug printing is unset

2006-02-06 12:39  p_cesar

	* Image rendering

2006-02-03 13:34  p_cesar

	* Ambulant does not crash with images

2006-02-01 13:53  p_cesar

	* Current status:	- <text> works fine	- <brush> works
	  fine	  - <img> does not get the proper image   - <audio> works
	  fine	  - <video> does not work	  - User interaction: not
	  provided yet	  - The GUI is copmleted and the .smil files can be
	  played	- Logger, open URL, open file... works

2006-02-01 13:45  p_cesar

	* renderer_text works with Pango

2006-02-01 09:31  p_cesar

	* Brush working Text working (only single line) Image on the way

2006-01-30 18:33  p_cesar

	* Brush and Background color in the regions are starting to work

2006-01-27 17:26  p_cesar

	* GdkPixmap is there

2006-01-27 14:56  p_cesar

	* Merging exp-pablo-gtk branch Initial implementation of GTK
	  support - GTK gui is working - GTK renderers are on the way

2006-01-23 16:49  jackjansen

	* Fairly serious reorganisation to make Windows renderers follow
	  the same pattern as Unix/Mac renderers.

2006-01-23 15:19  jackjansen

	* Adapted for factory function accessors.

2006-01-23 14:52  jackjansen

	* (temporarily?) disable early loading of plugins because it
	  doesn't work with the new accessor scheme for factories. To be
	  determined whether this is ok.

2006-01-23 14:47  jackjansen

	* More changes for WinCE wrt. datasourcde usage. Still doesn't
	  work, though.

2006-01-23 14:17  jackjansen

	* Added cleanup of m_factory.

2006-01-23 14:15  jackjansen

	* More factory function accessor mods.

2006-01-23 13:21  jackjansen

	* Tweaks for: - Using accessors for factory objects - WinCE port of
	  datasource mods.

2006-01-21 00:37  jackjansen

	* Step 1 towards a self-contained player: add accessor methods to
	  the factories object.

2006-01-20 23:57  jackjansen

	* Squashed warning.

2006-01-19 17:37  keesblom

	* Added mp3 codec_id as produced by the Helix RTSP Server

2006-01-12 22:11  jackjansen

	* This file was never added to the repository.

2006-01-12 16:51  jackjansen

	* Merge of exp-jack-win-datasource: Windows now also uses
	  datasources for getting static media. A new win32_datasource has
	  been added that can retrieve both local and http-based media. The
	  old win32_memfile has gone, and the platform-independent memfile
	  has been reworked to accept any datasource as argument and
	  provide a file-like interface.  In addition, a helper routine
	  read_data_from_datasource has been added that gets all the data
	  from a datasource in one fell swoop.

2006-01-10 16:15  jackjansen

	* net::url mods ported to WinCE. Untested.

2006-01-10 14:54  jackjansen

	* Merging branch exp-jack-winurl:

	  net::url objects now always contain a true URL (so no more
	  windows filenames).  The constructors (except the default one)
	  are hidden, and there are factory functions net::url::from_url()
	  and net::url::from_filename() that accept a URL and filename
	  string, respectively. Get_path() and get_file() are now really
	  different, and the latter should only be called if
	  is_local_file() is true. It returns a local-os-style pathname.

	  In addition there's a class method set_strict_url_parsing(bool)
	  that enables checking URLs for illegal characters (space, \,
	  etc).

2006-01-06 17:00  jackjansen

	* Merging changes for 1.6.1 (from ambulant-release-16-branch) back
	  to the trunk.

2006-01-06 13:28  jackjansen

	* New SDL version needs to be linked with AudioUnits framework.

2006-01-06 12:08  jackjansen

	* Got video colors correct on the Intel mac.

2005-12-16 15:07  jackjansen

	* Added a paragraph on merging fixes from the trunk to the release
	  branch.

2005-12-16 13:07  jackjansen

	* Fixed yet another bug in the handling of mixed url/windows
	  notation.

	  Backport candidate.

2005-12-16 12:55  jackjansen

	* Slightly better formatting of the message dialog.

2005-12-16 12:40  jackjansen

	* OpenURL also had the "double play" bug that Open File had. Fixed.

	  Bugfix candidate.

2005-12-15 16:02  jackjansen

	* - @executable_path is also okay as a dependency - modify the
	  library id for the xerces library too.

2005-12-15 15:20  jackjansen

	* During the build process, test for dependencies on non-Apple
	  libraries.  These are probably a signal of a problem (such as
	  inadvertently having linked with a library in /usr/local).

2005-12-13 16:58  jackjansen

	* Added ctrl-L as shortcut for Open URL.

2005-12-13 16:58  jackjansen

	* Argh. Off-by-one error in previous fix.

2005-12-13 16:50  jackjansen

	* Improved error reporting.

2005-12-13 16:49  jackjansen

	* URLs of the form "http://www.cwi.nl" (without trailing slash)
	  were not parsed correctly. Bugfix candidate.

2005-12-13 16:11  jackjansen

	* Check that SMIL documents actually have a <smil> root node (to
	  forestall trying to interpret random XML or HTML as smil)

2005-12-13 15:24  jackjansen

	* Post-release updating of version number to 1.7.

2005-12-13 15:20  jackjansen

	* Merging changes from release-ambulant-16-branch back to the
	  trunk.

2005-12-12 16:01  koelimoe

	* changed the live.com into live555.com

2005-12-12 15:23  jackjansen

	* Sleep/hibernate fixes (1.36 and 1.36) broke fullscreen
	  transitions. Fixed.

2005-12-09 17:09  dcab

	* Updated icon for 1.6 (win-mfc)

2005-12-09 17:09  dcab

	* Updated icon for 1.6 (winCE)

2005-12-09 17:08  dcab

	* Updated News page for 1.6

2005-12-09 13:41  koelimoe

	* Flashlight video plays again. I had to anable a hack to get it
	  working.

2005-12-08 12:10  keesblom

	* Updated readme

2005-12-07 16:32  keesblom

	* Added scriptable version of the Firefox plugin on Windows XP to
	  play .html files files with MIME-type application/smil in an
	  <embed> tag using libambulant_win32.

2005-12-07 15:41  keesblom

	* Removed initial version of the plugin, to replace it with a
	  scriptable one.

2005-12-06 11:53  koelimoe

	*  removed a unnecessary delete. this caused a crash.

2005-12-05 16:14  jackjansen

	* Fixed nasty bug: supported() used the c_str() of a std::string
	  that was not kept around.

2005-12-05 16:06  jackjansen

	* Various bug fixes and workarounds: - ffmpeg doesn't handle
	  seeking in quicktime/mp4 files correctly. Skip   in stead.  -
	  Scheduler doesn't issue stop() for some movies, so we do that
	  ourselves.	this is a hack.  - Drop B frames while skipping,
	  but I think this should be done in a	 different place (demux).
	  - m_video_clock was initialized to clip_begin in stead of 0.

2005-12-05 15:43  koelimoe

	* fixed cinepack video

2005-12-05 11:53  jackjansen

	* Added some cleanup code, and test some error conditions.

2005-12-02 16:07  keesblom

	* Plugin now also loads into Firefox in reasonable time, thanks to
	  Jacks' black magic.

2005-12-02 00:46  jackjansen

	* Some code needed to be in ifdefs.

2005-12-01 23:18  jackjansen

	* With xerces builtin, it was initialized too late leading to an
	  error message while parsing the settings file. Fixed.

2005-11-30 23:49  jackjansen

	* - Added code to give warnings when an obsolete DTD is used (SMIL
	  2.1 PR, etc).  - Enable that in the DTDCache.  - Include the
	  DTDCache in the OSX debugging builds.

2005-11-30 17:17  keesblom

	* Added scriptability to the Firefox plugin. It compiles and links,
	  but doesn't work yet.  Firefox hangs while trying to load the
	  plugin.

2005-11-30 13:38  koelimoe

	* Fixed: [ 1096356 ] make install installs CVS directories

2005-11-30 13:35  koelimoe

	* removed some unnessary files in live_VC7

2005-11-29 23:49  jackjansen

	* Squashed a few more gcc4 warnings.

2005-11-29 16:11  jackjansen

	* Minor updates.

2005-11-25 17:17  jackjansen

	* Third party packages for Windows updated. Also got rid of most of
	  the horrible #pragma lib constructs to load libraries, in stead
	  specifying them in the project files (with the exception of
	  various OLE and directx libraries).  And use all libraries except
	  xerces statically.

2005-11-25 17:15  jackjansen

	* Third party packages for Windows updated.

2005-11-25 16:41  jackjansen

	* Third party packages for Windows updated.

2005-11-25 11:09  keesblom

	* Changed MIME-type that the plugin supports to "application/smil"

2005-11-24 15:55  keesblom

	* Changed project properties and README.txt such that building the
	  firefox plugin really works with the downloaded SDK package from
	  Mozilla.org

2005-11-23 18:22  keesblom

	* Added firefox_plugin_win32 to the repository.  The initial
	  version works only on win32.	It can play .smil files (audio,
	  video, text and SMIL interaction).  No player controls yet
	  (start,stop,pause,preferences,log,xml settings) .  It is derived
	  from Mozilla's GeckoPluginSDK-samples which must be downloaded
	  and build first in third_party_packages.

2005-11-22 15:35  jackjansen

	* Added targets DebugNoHtmlNoXerces and ReleaseNoHtmlNoXerces for
	  the firefox plugin.

2005-11-21 17:42  jackjansen

	* Tweaks for new Xerces, intel-mac.

2005-11-21 17:29  jackjansen

	* Updated to Xerces 2.7.0

2005-11-21 15:52  jackjansen

	* Merged noxerces projects and solution into the standard one.

2005-11-21 15:24  jackjansen

	* Xerces and non-xerces versions of the Visual Studio files were
	  confused.  Fixed.

2005-11-21 14:20  jackjansen

	* Regenerated.

2005-11-21 13:02  jackjansen

	* Squashed more gcc 4 warnings.

2005-11-21 13:00  jackjansen

	* Ported to Xcode 2.2 and gcc 4.

2005-11-21 11:25  jackjansen

	* Gearing up towards the 1.6 distribution./

2005-11-20 18:11  jackjansen

	* Tweaks for xcode 2.2 and better cleanup.

2005-11-20 02:21  jackjansen

	* Minor mods for gcc 4.0.1/xcode 2.2.

2005-11-16 13:05  koelimoe

	* added VC7 project files for live.com

2005-11-16 11:48  keesblom

	* Removed memory leak time_node_calc, detected by Visual Leak
	  Detector

2005-11-10 15:58  jackjansen

	* Temporarily disabled going to fragments.

2005-11-10 15:17  jackjansen

	* Make "View Log" button actually show the log by sending a command
	  to the top view.

2005-11-10 15:17  jackjansen

	* Reverted to previous xerces.

2005-11-10 14:34  jackjansen

	* More special-case code for handling both windows pathnames and
	  URLs.

2005-11-10 10:15  jackjansen

	* Added callbacks to document_started() and document_stopped().

2005-11-09 17:07  keesblom

	* Added a fix for clipEnd==-1

2005-11-09 15:35  keesblom

	* Attempt to reduce flicker when using HtmlWidget by: - adding
	  WS_CLIPCHILDREN flag in style field of CREATESTRUCT in the
	  PreCreateWindow()   functions of HtmlView and Mmview - overriding
	  OnEraseBkgnd() function in HtmlView to let the system think that
	  background   drawing has already been done

	  There is still some undesirable behaviour: CHTMLView(url,...),
	  when url contains a tag in the middle of a page, first draws the
	  top of the page, immediately followed by the portion of the page
	  containing the tag. In Amis, Marisa DeMeglio has a solution for
	  this.

2005-11-09 14:33  koelimoe

	*  removed an forgotten /*AM_DBG*/

2005-11-09 14:31  koelimoe

	* fixed rtsp.

2005-11-08 15:49  jackjansen

	* Allow a hosting implementation to get callbacks for node and
	  document started and stopped. Not implemented yet for documents.

2005-11-08 14:32  jackjansen

	* Implemented handling of opening url#frag documents on windows and
	  starting the document at the right place.

2005-11-08 14:31  jackjansen

	* For some reason renderer.cpp was still in here (in stead of
	  renderer_impl).

2005-11-01 14:40  jackjansen

	* - Added build instructions for pdf - Regenerated

2005-11-01 13:41  jackjansen

	* More tweaks to make pyambulant build on Linux.

2005-10-31 16:38  jackjansen

	* Squashed the remaining warnings (which are errors under some
	  compilers): - Some _New methods needed to have const arguments.
	  - The hack for returning reference arguments returned from const
	  methods   wasn't good enough. Replaced by a different hack.

2005-10-31 16:34  jackjansen

	* Fixed "make check" and "make clean".

2005-10-28 17:21  jackjansen

	* Hack for compiling on FC4: allow xml_parser::parse with two
	  slightly different signatures.

2005-10-28 16:50  jackjansen

	* ENABLE_NLS needs to be defined to enable compiling on FC4.

2005-10-28 14:52  jackjansen

	* ShowMessage dialog with a "show log" button.

2005-10-17 14:08  jackjansen

	* Handle the ShowMessage ourselves, so we can add a "Show Log"
	  button. Not complete: we need to resize the message box and the
	  "Show Log" button doesn't work yet.

2005-10-14 16:36  koelimoe

	* fixed rtsp [only tested with audio]

2005-10-14 13:53  jackjansen

	* It turns out the solution to the mountains problem is
	  implementing get_start_time() correctly: it should return the
	  actual timestamp of the first sample returned to the user (i.e.
	  depending on whether the datasource implements clip_begin or not
	  it returns clip_begin or 0).

2005-10-14 13:23  jackjansen

	* Pathnames got mangled in 1.22 (maybe due to Kees' machine having
	  a different layout?), reverting to 1.21.

2005-10-14 11:56  jackjansen

	* If clip_begin doesn't fall on the boundary of a data buffer we
	  need to gobble up some bytes from the beginning of the buffer
	  before passing it to the client.

2005-10-14 11:27  jackjansen

	* Newer ffmpeg seems to have some rtsp support, but it doesn't work
	  yet.	For that reason we specifically forego passing rtsp urls to
	  ffmpeg, so we don't get confused by error messages (thinking they
	  come from Live).

2005-10-14 10:28  koelimoe

	* changes to clipend clipbegin

2005-10-12 13:54  keesblom

	* Changes s.t. "make distcheck" works up to "make uninstall" (but
	  not beyond)

2005-10-11 17:10  jackjansen

	* Added a couple of hacks to make linked documents work again on
	  Windows. But we really need to cleanup the URL stuff...

2005-10-11 16:43  jackjansen

	* Various fixes to make clip_end work. Appears to be incomplete,
	  because now the player hangs occasionally.

2005-10-11 00:10  jackjansen

	* Adapted pyambulant to the current state of the API, and added a
	  note about updating it to the readme.

2005-10-10 16:39  jackjansen

	* Reverting 1.66.2.1, which changed to order of deleting objects on
	  cleanup of the smil_player. That change caused a crash when
	  jumping from one document to the next (as in the Nokia tests),
	  and I can't remember at all what it tried to fix.

2005-10-10 16:22  keesblom

	* Reverted back to version 1.8

2005-10-10 14:53  jackjansen

	* Fixed build procedure on 10.4 (Help file indexing).

2005-10-10 14:52  jackjansen

	* Additions for Cocoa html renderer.

2005-10-10 14:40  jackjansen

	* --with-expat argument was ignored, fixed.

	  Fixes #1306933.

2005-10-10 14:19  keesblom

	* Added missing file pkg.m4 to EXTRA_DIST

2005-10-10 12:45  jackjansen

	* License changed to LGPL.

2005-10-10 10:36  jackjansen

	* Detail

2005-10-07 17:06  jackjansen

	* Details.

2005-10-07 17:05  jackjansen

	* Don't attempt to read terminating ";", apparently there are GIF
	  files without it.

2005-10-07 16:22  jackjansen

	* Got clip-begin and clip-end working on Windows.

2005-10-07 15:07  keesblom

	* Changed default backgroundColor to white.

2005-10-07 13:25  jackjansen

	* Updated.

2005-10-07 11:54  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-cocoa-html branch: general cleanup of HTML
	  rendering.

2005-09-30 14:23  keesblom

	* Extended qt_html_renderer such that it can render simultaneously
	  multiple html pages in different regions.

2005-09-29 22:32  jackjansen

	* This outdated file was still around. Removed.

2005-09-29 15:35  keesblom

	* Re-wrote the HTML widget for Linux to look like the HTML widget
	  for Windows, re-using the browser object by remembering it in
	  "surface_impl" data struct.

2005-09-29 11:38  jackjansen

	* - Don't try to push 0 bytes into a databuffer - Added asserts to
	  guard against this

	  Fixes #1122383.

2005-09-28 16:00  jackjansen

	* Fixed a locking problem that could cause  a crash when stopping
	  the presentation during video playback.

2005-09-28 15:58  jackjansen

	* Fixed very old bug: after "Open Recent" the play command was
	  issued twice.  For some reason this was never a problem (probably
	  because the first open finished before the second one was
	  scheduled, which then was a no-op) but it suddenly is.

2005-09-28 15:56  jackjansen

	* Better error messages for audio/video problems (unsupported
	  format, protocol). Fixes #1205996.

2005-09-28 13:53  jackjansen

	* Fixed very old bug: after "Open File" the play command was issued
	  twice.  For some reason this was never a problem (probably
	  because the first open finished before the second one was
	  scheduled, which then was a no-op) but it suddenly is.

2005-09-28 13:52  jackjansen

	* Added assert.

2005-09-27 15:09  jackjansen

	* Python interface is in a state where it is ready for general
	  testing.  Added generated module to the CVS repository, and
	  include building of the ambulant module to configure/automake
	  (depending on --with-python configure option).

2005-09-27 15:02  jackjansen

	* Modified autogen.sh so that it automatically includes our m4
	  directory for aclocal.

2005-09-27 11:53  koelimoe

	* small mod. the status variable wasn't set back to zero after
	  checking for required m4 macro's

2005-09-26 17:16  jackjansen

	* - Added a type HeapTupleType that allocates the struct on the
	  heap. This does   mean that the memory is leaked, unless the API
	  frees it.  - Use HeapTupleType to implement factories: the
	  pointer to the struct is   long-lived. This is a cop-out (the
	  memory-leak note above holds), we should   probably look at the
	  API again.

2005-09-26 16:57  jackjansen

	* Removed debug.

2005-09-26 16:11  jackjansen

	* - Always require exact match in xxx_Check().	- When constructing
	  a C++ wrapper around a Python object check that   all methods
	  exist (attribute name check only) and issue warnings	 for
	  missing methods.

2005-09-26 16:02  koelimoe

	* fixed: ffmpeg_demux bug for ffmpeg-cvs. audio only made
	  ffmpeg-demux cradsh

2005-09-26 15:39  koelimoe

	* little fix needed to compile ambulantplayer after my last changes

2005-09-26 14:10  koelimoe

	* corrected the calculation of timestamps for ffmpeg-cvs

2005-09-26 13:42  jackjansen

	* A few quick hacks to make debugging easier.

2005-09-26 11:32  jackjansen

	* Fixes to make debug builds work.

2005-09-23 17:19  jackjansen

	* Added a define that builds a none_player.

2005-09-23 17:15  jackjansen

	* Parent of region can be NULL, when a node is rendered to the
	  default region.

2005-09-23 17:04  jackjansen

	* Removed erronuous assert.

2005-09-23 17:00  jackjansen

	* Things go wrong when defines like USE_SMIL21 are different during
	  library building and application building. Temporarily made the
	  flags the same, but this will need a better solution later.

2005-09-23 16:12  koelimoe

	* removed an assumtion on the frameduration

2005-09-23 15:37  koelimoe

	* some minor fixes and comments added

2005-09-23 13:47  koelimoe

	* The pts is calculated correctly now in ffmpeg_demux::run

2005-09-23 13:32  koelimoe

	* i1) fixed my previous checkin 2) fixed the timing for ffmpeg-cvs
	  (build 4629)

2005-09-23 00:33  jackjansen

	* - updated posix_datasource and stdio_datasource to the modern
	  semantics   of the API.  - added dump method to event_processor.

2005-09-22 11:35  jackjansen

	* Use PyArg_ParseTuple, not PyArg_Parse, to parse tuples.

2005-09-21 23:57  jackjansen

	* Wrap window_factory (to help find nasty SystemError reason).

2005-09-21 23:57  jackjansen

	* Indentation error caused constructor methods to be skipped unless
	  debug was defined:-)

2005-09-21 23:24  jackjansen

	* Added am_get_codec_var calls so it compiles with cvs ffmpeg.

2005-09-21 16:31  koelimoe

	* small fix for a small change made in datasource.h

2005-09-21 15:45  koelimoe

	* adaptations for ffmpeg-cvs

2005-09-20 23:52  jackjansen

	* Detail.

2005-09-20 23:50  jackjansen

	* After an inline method all subsequent methods were inadvertantly
	  considered private. Fixed.

2005-09-20 23:14  jackjansen

	* Changed the interface for read_data_from_url: in stead of
	  returning the size and eror indication combined we return a bool
	  error condition and return the size through a size_t *.

2005-09-20 23:12  jackjansen

	* We double-wrapped C++ objects passed to Python and then back to
	  C++. Fixed.

2005-09-20 17:14  jackjansen

	* Release the Python GIL while in the ambulant engine.

2005-09-20 16:21  jackjansen

	* Made the datasource_factory getter functions real functions in
	  stead of inlines.

2005-09-20 16:20  jackjansen

	* Pathnames in URLs were not always returned correctly for local
	  files. Fixed this, but this could break workarounds that were in
	  place for the previous bug.

2005-09-20 16:12  jackjansen

	* Made a bit more resilient against errors.

2005-09-20 11:04  keesblom

	* Added a fix for recovery of a DERR_SURFACELOST error, that often
	  occurs at wakeup from sleep/hibernate or screensaver. Any such
	  recovery is logged.

2005-09-19 13:19  jackjansen

	* Added a const_cast (and put the const back in).

2005-09-19 13:06  jackjansen

	* Added pkg_config macros.

2005-09-17 20:18  koelimoe

	* fix to solve a fedora core 4 (gcc 4.0 related) compile problem

2005-09-16 17:57  jackjansen

	* Added get_posix_datasource_factory() and
	  get_stdio_datasource_factory() so we don't have to call the
	  constructors directly.

2005-09-16 17:43  keesblom

	* Added some experimental Restore() calls as suggested by Jack to
	  avoid DERR_SURFACE. Tested with Sleep. It seems that checking
	  using IsLost() before the Blt() often doesn't help, but Restore()
	  when the error is detected is very effective.

2005-09-16 16:24  jackjansen

	* Started on a dummy app that uses the Python interface.

2005-09-16 14:50  keesblom

	* Implemented new datatypes renderer_data and renderer_id

2005-09-16 14:35  koelimoe

	* leftovers :-)

2005-09-16 13:45  koelimoe

	* small fix to make it compile on linux again

2005-09-16 11:33  koelimoe

	* fix for the ffmpeg CVS version & added a comment to databuffer

2005-09-16 11:29  jackjansen

	* Added "const" to a couple of interfaces that are const.

2005-09-16 11:28  jackjansen

	* Test not only for the qt frontend, but for any GUI frontend.

2005-09-16 11:17  jackjansen

	* Updated for current state of the interfaces.

2005-09-15 22:43  jackjansen

	* Removed more turds.

2005-09-15 22:18  jackjansen

	* - Trigger ffmpeg conditional code on the value of
	  LIBAVFORMAT_BUILD (and   LIBAVCODEC_BUILD), which seem to be
	  updated rather faithfully by the ffmpeg   developers when they
	  change something incompatibly. Only did the	ifdefs for the new
	  cvs-ffmpeg code so far.  - Don't use the am_get_codec_var() macro
	  half-way inside an expression,   moved it to the outermost level.

2005-09-15 22:15  jackjansen

	* Fixed instructions.

2005-09-15 22:15  jackjansen

	* Removed turds.

2005-09-15 17:23  keesblom

	* Added redraw function to html_browser

2005-09-15 16:56  koelimoe

	* ao a fix for kees, got rid of the round in parselets so it
	  compiles on windows

2005-09-15 16:48  koelimoe

	* adaptions made to deal with ffmpeg CVS

2005-09-15 16:20  koelimoe

	* last fix to make ambulant + ffmpeg CVS compile in the autogen.sh
	  env.

2005-09-15 15:23  jackjansen

	* Typo.

2005-09-15 15:01  jackjansen

	* Ffmpeg libraries were added to the wrong define.

2005-09-15 14:40  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-newconfigure (with some mods): Christian
	  Schaller donated code that uses autogen.sh to create configure
	  and friends. In addition, configure now uses pkg_config for a
	  couple of packages, and Ambulant also creates the .pc files to
	  allow other packages to use it through pkg-config.  Attempted to
	  keep support for post-0.4.9 ffmpeg working too (but untested).

2005-09-14 10:04  koelimoe

	* Preparing the configure/makefile stuff for ffmpeg from CVS

2005-09-14 10:03  koelimoe

	* mproved ntp parser

2005-09-13 11:43  koelimoe

	* fixes for the mediaclipping parsers

2005-09-12 14:08  jackjansen

	* Details.

2005-09-12 11:17  koelimoe

	* added a missing variable declaration, to ffmpeg video decoder

2005-09-09 16:39  koelimoe

	* created mediaclipping parsers

2005-09-09 11:03  jackjansen

	* - Be more sensible about when restarting input in the video
	  decoder. This   solves the "no data, no eof?" problem and brings
	  the CPU usage down to   a more reasonable level.  - Effectively
	  got rid of MIN_VIDEO_FRAMES by setting it to zero.

2005-09-09 11:00  jackjansen

	* Added a note about removing doxygen output before building a
	  distribution.

2005-09-09 10:53  jackjansen

	* Updated POTFILE.in to reflect new and moved files.

2005-09-09 00:08  jackjansen

	* Added statistics to video renderer, printed at end of video:
	  frames displayed, early, late, dup, NULL.

2005-09-08 16:45  jackjansen

	* - start_frame() expects a timestamp relative to the
	  event_processor   timer, but we were giving it a time relative to
	  our movie-epoch.    Temporarily fixed by converting in the video
	  renderer, but a better solution    would be to move the video
	  clock to the video datasource (in stead    of having it in the
	  renderer)  - the video renderer would re-display a frame that is
	  already on-screen.	fixed.

2005-09-08 15:16  keesblom

	* Made the html_widget bound to the surface_impl (instead of a
	  static pointer).  No cleanup when the surface_impl vanishes, no
	  multiple widgets.

2005-09-08 14:47  jackjansen

	* New_aux_audio_playable() is no longer optional.

2005-09-08 13:45  koelimoe

	* removed a stupid comment

2005-09-07 23:53  jackjansen

	* - Timestamp computations were still incorrect: we also corrected
	  values for   frames which had a timestamp.  - Frame dropping
	  wasn't complete either: if a frame later than the current   frame
	  has already made it to the consumer (and m_old_frame) we should
	  drop the frame in data_avail.  - Added a MIN_VIDEO_FRAME to cater
	  for a very fast consumer, but I'm not   sure it actually makes a
	  difference.

2005-09-06 12:17  keesblom

	* HTML browser per region-step 1: adding data fields in
	  surface_impl

2005-09-05 17:49  jackjansen

	* - Clarified the semantics that thread->start() is idempotent, and
	  implemented	and used those semantics. This will probably fix
	  the valgrind problems   we had with running out of threads
	  (because we could inadvertantly create   tens of thousands of
	  them).  - Cleaned up a couple of memory leaks in the ffmpeg code.
	  Tested only with   ffmpeg 0.4.8 and without live.  - Played with
	  assert()s.

2005-09-05 17:29  jackjansen

	* Merging ie_html_widget branch: we now have a (somewhat) working
	  HTML widget on windows.

2005-09-05 15:49  jackjansen

	* get_aux_audio_playable() is no longer optional.

2005-09-05 14:29  jackjansen

	* - Got rid of the default implementation of
	  get_aux_audio_playable,   making the class pure virtual again.  -
	  Added a comment to the ffmpeg sources that globallly enabling
	  AM_DBG output   is a bad idea.

2005-09-02 14:33  koelimoe

	* smtpe parselet

2005-09-02 13:24  koelimoe

	* creating special parsers for clipBegin clipEnd

2005-08-31 10:54  koelimoe

	* clip_begin clip_end is parsed using parselets now

2005-08-05 14:14  jackjansen

	* Finally found (and fixed) the Linux/Mac audio problems (hiccups
	  during playback): the logic in the datasources was incorrect.
	  Now, the datasource start() method will restart input on it's
	  datasource if it has buffer space available.

2005-08-04 17:04  jackjansen

	* Added assertions, fixed some debug output.

2005-08-04 17:02  jackjansen

	* - Stop() would sometimes keep a lock. Fixed.	- Stop() could be
	  called with the lock held. Fixed.

2005-08-04 17:01  jackjansen

	*
	  Diudn't get removed during the merge.

2005-08-03 12:59  jackjansen

	* Missed 2 singletons.

2005-08-03 12:43  jackjansen

	* The factories are destroyed when a document is closed, so
	  implementing them as singletons was not a good idea.

2005-08-02 23:34  jackjansen

	* Started filling the credits file.

2005-08-02 17:03  jackjansen

	* 64bit fix.

2005-08-02 15:59  jackjansen

	* Gcc 4.0 compatibility fix.

2005-08-02 15:21  jackjansen

	* Finally ran boost configure, and gcc 4.0 seems indentical to 3.4.

2005-08-02 12:44  jackjansen

	* (Finally) added version number to the installer, so we don't have
	  to manually rename it. Also documented this.

2005-08-02 12:42  jackjansen

	* Somehow the Dirac fix stopped working today. More aggressive fix:
	  completely ignore duration if it is zero.

2005-08-02 12:42  jackjansen

	* Details.

2005-08-01 17:15  jackjansen

	* Split ffmpeg and demux code and headers in a couple of distinct
	  files: - ffmpeg_factory.h has factory functions -
	  demux_datasource.h has non-ffmpeg-dependent demultiplexing
	  datasources - ffmpeg_audio.h has ffmpeg audio support -
	  ffmpeb_video has ffmpeg video support - ffmpeg_common has the
	  common code (demux, init, etc)

2005-08-01 11:28  jackjansen

	* More cleanup

2005-07-28 16:23  jackjansen

	* Dirac now works on the Mac too.

2005-07-28 15:11  jackjansen

	* Ignore avcodec_decode_video return value for ffmpeg 0.4.9. This
	  makes dirac work on Linux.

2005-07-28 14:25  jackjansen

	* Dirac support.

2005-07-28 14:15  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-diracvideo: - factored clipBegin/clipEnd support
	  code out - implemented clipBegin/clipEnd for QuickTime - fixed
	  ffmpeg timestamps/clipBegin/clipEnd - cleaned up bits of ffmpeg

2005-07-28 13:46  jackjansen

	* - Factored out clipBegin/clipEnd parsing code and put it into
	  renderer_playable - Implemented clipBegin/clipEnd support for
	  QuickTime video renderer.

2005-07-28 00:06  jackjansen

	* Fixed lots of issues with ffmpeg, including clipBegin/clipEnd,
	  garbage collection and more.

	  Unfortunately Dirac still doesn't play back. And mp4 support is
	  broken in ffmpeg 0.4.9:-(

2005-07-26 14:36  jackjansen

	* - Fixed ffmpeg video playback on MacOS. Note that the fix may be
	  10.4-only, I'm not sure.  - Added a preference so selection of
	  quicktime/ffmpeg video playback is   now a runtime option (as
	  opposed to compile-time).

2005-07-25 16:26  jackjansen

	* Added support for a build with ffmpeg-0.4.9 and dirac.
	  Unfortunately it doesn't play dirac video yet.

	  Squashed a couple more warnings.

2005-07-25 14:56  jackjansen

	* - The updating of various fields (width, height, samplerate, etc)
	  in   m_fmt of the video and audio decoders was a mess.
	  Rationalized.  - squashed various warnings.

	  These have made rtsp support work somewhat on MacOSX.

2005-07-25 13:45  jackjansen

	* - Enabled rtsp support in xcode-based build on the mac.  - Got
	  xerces support in xcode-based build working.

2005-07-25 01:24  jackjansen

	* For audio also implemented early testing that the format can be
	  decoded.  Only slightly tested.

2005-07-25 00:56  jackjansen

	* Before creating a video datasource check also that the codec is
	  supported, in stead of only checking that the file format is.
	  This gives better error messages, and forestalls a crash.

2005-07-24 23:44  jackjansen

	* Removed debug.

2005-07-24 23:43  jackjansen

	* get_dur(), or actually the underlying ffmpeg_demux::duration(),
	  didn't cater for clipBegin and clipEnd. Fixed.

2005-07-24 23:13  jackjansen

	* m_goto_node wasn't initialized leading to random crashes.

2005-07-22 16:06  jackjansen

	* Detail

2005-07-22 14:01  jackjansen

	* Addedan extra indictation that this is a development installer

2005-07-22 14:00  jackjansen

	* A few leftovers from the node changes.

2005-07-22 13:13  jackjansen

	* A few leftovers from class name changes.

2005-07-21 23:24  jackjansen

	* merging exp-jack-classnames, which renames a fair number of
	  classes: - The "active_" and "passive_" prefixes are gone (except
	  in the MMS   scheduler where they actually still mean something).
	  - various incorrect uses of "abstract_" are gone - if something
	  has a virtual API and an implementation the unadorned   name is
	  used for the api and the implementation has "_impl" appended.

2005-07-19 17:13  jackjansen

	* Squashed another warning.

2005-07-19 15:52  jackjansen

	* Details.

2005-07-19 15:40  jackjansen

	* Squashed a few more warnings seen on Windows

2005-07-19 15:09  jackjansen

	* Squashed all compiler warnings as detected by XCode.

2005-07-19 15:07  jackjansen

	* - Added another note on machine-dependent defines - regenerated
	  html

2005-07-19 00:13  jackjansen

	* Added notes on the new (1.5 onwards) branch/tag naming scheme and
	  a couple more guidelines on doing distributions.

2005-07-18 23:44  jackjansen

	* Merged 1.4 branch up to 1.4.5. Set a tag
	  release-ambulant-145-merge on the branch.

2005-07-18 16:43  keesblom

	* Added more locks in a (vain) attempt to avoid segmentation
	  violations

2005-07-14 16:12  keesblom

	* Turned off #define AM_DBG

2005-07-13 14:01  koelimoe

	* fixed video render stuff that i broke

2005-07-13 11:45  koelimoe

	* fixed video sound

2005-07-13 11:35  koelimoe

	* small fixes to rtsp code to make it compile again, after jacks
	  branch  exp_jack_classnames got merged with the trunk.

2005-07-11 11:36  jackjansen

	* Dead wood removal.

2005-07-11 11:25  jackjansen

	* Added region_dim

2005-07-11 00:02  jackjansen

	* Fixed an error message and removed dead wood.

2005-07-11 00:02  jackjansen

	* Removed one line too many

2005-07-10 23:48  jackjansen

	* Got rid of some dead wood.

2005-07-10 23:42  jackjansen

	* Animation_destination done.

2005-07-08 17:29  jackjansen

	* Various improvements in the API (triggered by the Python bridge).

2005-07-08 17:28  jackjansen

	* Added support for audio_format_choices.

2005-07-08 15:56  koelimoe

	* added m_lock

2005-07-08 13:53  jackjansen

	* Get rid of all ther std::pair<bool, double>, replaced by
	  common::duration, defined in playable.h. For now, I'm not sure
	  where the right location is.

2005-07-08 12:54  koelimoe

	* added m_locks that i forgot

2005-07-08 11:54  jackjansen

	* - Fixed a few issues with std::pair support - Added
	  transition_info

2005-07-07 23:59  jackjansen

	* Started on support for std::pair.

2005-07-07 16:13  koelimoe

	* added mimetype support to the audio/video_format.  fixed missing
	  samplerate on wav files.

2005-07-06 18:45  jackjansen

	* Refined the type RE to catch even more methods.  Better error
	  handling for callbacks.

2005-07-06 14:42  keesblom

	* Now the html widget is contained within the region associated
	  with the tag.

2005-07-06 14:19  jackjansen

	* Refactored test to use a suite.

2005-07-06 12:06  keesblom

	* Made configure --with-qt-html-widget=yes work again

2005-07-06 11:34  keesblom

	* Added qt_html_renderer (which momentarily doesn't work).  Changed
	  configure.in, s.t. --with-qt-html-widget=false by default.

2005-07-06 00:07  jackjansen

	* - Added a call to PyEval_InitThreads in the module init function
	  - Acquire the GIL also in the C++ wrapper constructor.

	  These fix the crash in the callback, things seem to be starting
	  to work!

2005-07-05 23:00  jackjansen

	* Got the callback mechanism working, somewhat: after 6 callbacks
	  Python crashes.

2005-07-04 17:27  jackjansen

	* Global_playable_factory has changed.

2005-07-04 17:24  jackjansen

	* Added a few more dummy methods.

2005-07-04 17:17  jackjansen

	* We need to match type of objects to be passed to C++ exactly,
	  otherwise we will not get any extended behaviour added in
	  (Python) subclasses of the C++ class.

	  Therefore, started on creation of C++->Python wrapper objects on
	  demand, i.e. when a Python object is passed to C++.

	  This revealed a couple of problems with not all vritual methods
	  of the (C++) baseclass being suitably overridden, due to (a)
	  "const" parameter problems and (b) methods not being
	  representable in Python.

	  Solved first case by getting "const" right. Started on solving
	  the second by allowing the insterion of dummy methods into the
	  wrapped class definition.

2005-07-04 16:13  keesblom

	* Merget the new qt_html_widget code into the trunk.

2005-07-04 14:21  jackjansen

	* - Refined REs to allow type/rest of declaration to be on separate
	  lines.  - Added more testing.

2005-07-04 00:10  jackjansen

	* Turned global_playable_factory into an abstract class with
	  corresponding implementation global_playable_factory_impl and a
	  factory function get_global_playable_factory.

	  Also a few other minor interface changes to accomodate the Python
	  bridge.

2005-07-04 00:06  jackjansen

	* - Added support for exporting non-default constructors to Python.
	  A   similar idea may be useable to export methods that only
	  differ in signature	(with the same name) to Python using
	  multimethods, I hope! - Added none_window_factory to the exported
	  classes.  - The test script created the first document, yeah!

2005-07-01 23:02  jackjansen

	* Hit the first snag: constructors aren't supported.

2005-07-01 22:26  jackjansen

	* - Use getargsPreCheck to only declare std::string handler helper
	  variables   when needed.  - Added serious hack that allows
	  returning references from C++->Python   bridge methods: we
	  allocate variables for the references in the class   declaration.
	  It is ugly code that generates it, and it creates warnings   for
	  const methods, but it works.	- Started on a test suite based on
	  unittest. Initially I'll concentrate	 on testing the bridge,
	  later we may be able to use this to test all	 of ambulant.

2005-07-01 22:06  jackjansen

	* Got rid of "pyapi" again.

2005-06-30 17:01  jackjansen

	* - Combine declaration and assignment of return value temporary,
	  thereby allowing const return values.  - Handle std::string and
	  friends inline.  - Started on code to handle structs that can be
	  passed as tuples on the Python side.

2005-06-30 00:12  jackjansen

	* - Found a way to get rid of ugly "pyapi" keyword: by using
	  different   patterns depending on being inside a class
	  declaration or not.  - This necessitated being aware of
	  visibility of methods (public/private/   protected) and
	  generating interfaces only for public methods.

2005-06-29 17:17  jackjansen

	* First test of the pyapi "keyword", which signals that a method
	  should be exported to Python.

2005-06-29 17:16  jackjansen

	* Sigh. The only way I can think of finding the non-virtual methods
	  that we want to export to Python is by adding a "keyword". I've
	  picked "pyapi".

2005-06-29 16:48  jackjansen

	* - better scope handling in the parser - got read_data_from_url()
	  wrapped.

2005-06-29 16:18  jackjansen

	* Skip non-virtual methods in the C++ to Python bridge, and skip
	  objects if they have no virtual methods at all. Also, in the
	  Python->C++ bridge,  cater for the C++ to Python object not being
	  generated.

2005-06-29 14:23  jackjansen

	* Another milestone: some of the calls actually work
	  (get_version(), creating timer objects and getting the time from
	  them).

2005-06-29 14:18  jackjansen

	* More changes wrt. changing interfaces to be more abstract.

2005-06-29 13:59  jackjansen

	* - Use rect in preference to basic_rect<int>.	- Use
	  abstract_timer in stead of timer whenever possible.

2005-06-29 12:33  jackjansen

	* Use abstract_timer in stead of timer in event_processor API.

2005-06-29 00:09  jackjansen

	* Added AMBULANTAPI to various external definitions.

2005-06-29 00:06  jackjansen

	* Various methods were skipped. Fixed, but now it doesn't compile
	  anymore due to duplicate names.

2005-06-28 17:21  jackjansen

	* Another milestone: everything compiles, links and loads into
	  Python.

2005-06-24 15:15  koelimoe

	* improvements to the clip_end clip_begin code.

2005-06-24 01:20  jackjansen

	* Cookies shouldn't be constant.

2005-06-24 00:38  jackjansen

	* Return cookies by value, not by reference. Simplifies Python
	  interface and does no harm.

2005-06-24 00:29  jackjansen

	* - system turned out to be a bad name for a class, it's a
	  namespace in the   standard C++ library, it seems. Renamed to
	  system_embedder.

2005-06-24 00:28  jackjansen

	* - The C++ classes encapsulating Python objects now declare the
	  corresponding   xxx_New() functions to be friends, and those
	  functions thereby forestall	double-wrapping of Python objects
	  passed through C++.  - system turned out to be a bad name for a
	  class, it's a namespace in the   standard C++ library, it seems.
	  Renamed to system_embedder.

2005-06-23 09:34  koelimoe

	* improvements to the clip_begin and clip_end infrastucture.  the
	  video_renderer takes care of skipping video if the datasource is
	  unable to do so. For audio the decoder takes care of this, later
	  the audio renderers wil have to do skipping of data.

2005-06-22 22:38  jackjansen

	* Adapted for changes in bgen wrt. type support and a few other
	  tweaks.

2005-06-22 21:46  jackjansen

	* Reorganized a bit.

2005-06-22 00:20  jackjansen

	* It is generating some code. Far from correct, though.

2005-06-21 23:26  jackjansen

	* Split callback module in a .cpp and .h file.

2005-06-21 22:55  jackjansen

	* A few more steps.

2005-06-17 14:59  marisademeglio

	* Added debug info gathering option to project settings

2005-06-17 14:18  marisademeglio

	* Linked to MFC Multithreaded Debug DLL

2005-06-17 12:47  jackjansen

	* Added targets for DebugShlib.

2005-06-17 12:46  jackjansen

	* Fixed bug in unicode-ifying.

2005-06-16 23:28  jackjansen

	* Fair amount of new code for creating the callback wrapper
	  objects. The classes are created, along with empty methods.

2005-06-16 15:21  jackjansen

	* Switched to unicode (from MBCS).

2005-06-16 13:08  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-virtual-nodes branch: - When building with
	  WITH_EXTERNAL_DOM the node class becomes virtual,   with the old
	  implementation class named node_impl. This virtual class   allows
	  use of external DOM implementations (at a small iperformance
	  cost for the native DOM case).  - Started on a Python interface
	  to Ambulant.

2005-06-13 16:42  koelimoe

	* added clip_end to ffmpeg_datasource

2005-06-09 13:22  koelimoe

	* fixed the rtsp video. (but there are still some ffmpeg error
	  msgs)

2005-06-07 16:58  koelimoe

	* changed the rtsp_demuxer so it puts all data for one frame
	  together

2005-06-07 13:56  koelimoe

	* fixed ffmpeg-0.4.9 video. (altough it seems that there is still a
	  problem with timestamps)

2005-06-06 15:16  koelimoe

	* added the ifdef AMBULANT_PLATFORM_MACOS around MAYBE_CONST defien
	  because it's only for mac

2005-06-06 15:10  koelimoe

	* moved ffmpeg_init() from the .h file to the .cpp file

2005-06-02 16:25  koelimoe

	* 1) SDL renderer now also looks for clip-begin and clip-end 2)
	  fixed a bug in clip_end

2005-06-01 23:49  jackjansen

	* Initial gcc4 fixes.

2005-06-01 22:50  koelimoe

	* 1) added clip_begin clip_end to the constructors of
	  audio_datasources.  2) fixed the multiple thread->start() calls

2005-05-31 13:22  koelimoe

	*  removed /*AM_DBG*/

2005-05-31 13:06  koelimoe

	* working clip end. (tested for audio)

2005-05-30 16:27  jackjansen

	* Upped version number to 1.5.

2005-05-30 14:57  jackjansen

	* Merging changes from release-ambulant-140 branch, up to
	  release-ambulant-141-tag.

2005-05-30 13:15  koelimoe

	* clip_end implementation. (untested)

2005-05-23 16:15  koelimoe

	* updated version numbers

2005-05-23 16:14  koelimoe

	* added some assertion

2005-05-12 15:48  koelimoe

	* added asserts and a read_ahead method for the video_demuxer

2005-05-11 15:58  koelimoe

	* added read_ahead methods to the audio and video datasources. the
	  demuxers start to read data on a start(_frame) or read_ahead call

2005-05-10 13:23  keesblom

	* Missing return caused core dump because return value was
	  undefined.

2005-05-09 16:54  koelimoe

	* added a simple seek for rtsp.

2005-05-09 12:09  keesblom

	* Calling pthread_cond_timedwait() with NULL pointer for the
	  abstime parameter caused core dump, use pthread_cond_wait in that
	  case Improved debug messages in qt_fill.cpp

2005-05-04 16:52  koelimoe

	* updated the cvs2cl options

2005-05-02 17:40  keesblom

	* Modification for Fedora Core 3 (gcc 3.4.3)

2005-04-29 13:37  jackjansen

	* Final tweaks.

2005-04-29 13:36  jackjansen

	* Upped version number.

2005-04-29 13:36  jackjansen

	* Updated.

2005-04-29 12:59  jackjansen

	* Updating version to 1.4.

2005-04-29 12:58  jackjansen

	* Disabled ffpmeg video playback (for the time being that is only
	  for debugging purposes on the Mac).

2005-04-28 17:02  keesblom

	* Added some #ifdef USE_SMIL21 to make it compile for Zaurus

2005-04-28 13:00  koelimoe

	* made the audio decoder ask for the  bits (8 or 16) at the demuxer

2005-04-28 12:53  koelimoe

	*  little fix

2005-04-28 12:52  koelimoe

	* added a remark for compiling	ffmpeg-0.4.8 and FC 3

2005-04-28 12:51  koelimoe

	* fixed rtsp timestamps

2005-04-28 12:38  jackjansen

	* It's CR, not RC.

2005-04-27 17:39  keesblom

	* Rewrote ffmpeg_video_decoder_datasource::get_frame() to use the
	  new _pop_top_frame internal function (which remembers the old top
	  frame in m_old_frame, and frees the data of previous old frame).

2005-04-27 15:42  keesblom

	* Cleanup added for video (45 MB for 10 seconds video was wasted).

2005-04-27 13:31  jackjansen

	* Added a section on SMIL 2.1 (to augment the one-liner that was
	  there already).  Documented the fact that soundAlign and
	  backgroundRepeat are not implemented on WinCE.

2005-04-27 13:23  jackjansen

	* Icon updated to 1.4.

2005-04-27 13:20  jackjansen

	* Some of the transparant bits were wrong.

2005-04-27 12:57  jackjansen

	* Added msvcr71.dll

2005-04-27 12:53  jackjansen

	* Added mobile and extended mobile profiles.

2005-04-27 12:47  jackjansen

	* Also updated the wince icons and the windows small icon.

2005-04-27 11:53  jackjansen

	* Got set-animation of soundAlign to work.

2005-04-27 10:52  jackjansen

	* Added two notes on things to check before distributing

2005-04-27 10:49  jackjansen

	* Enabled SMIL 2.1 support for Wince.

2005-04-27 00:10  jackjansen

	* Unencumbered by an actual clue of what I'm doing I'm adding more
	  bits and pieces for souldAlign animation.

2005-04-26 17:05  keesblom

	* Reorganized m_frames to have a dedicated data type and a proper
	  compare functios.

2005-04-26 16:10  jackjansen

	* Missed ifdef USE_SMIL21

2005-04-26 16:07  jackjansen

	* Implemented audioFade.

2005-04-26 14:42  jackjansen

	* SMIL soundLevel is linear, not logarithmic.

2005-04-25 17:37  jackjansen

	* XMLstrings must apparently (on Windows, at least, under some
	  circumstances) be freed with XMLString::Release, not with delete.

2005-04-25 16:00  jackjansen

	* 1.4 icons. Not pretty.

2005-04-25 15:29  jackjansen

	* When opening a document make sure we have an absolute pathname.
	  Partial fix for #1185955.

2005-04-25 14:12  jackjansen

	* - Fix for #1186570: soundAlign and soundLevel on a region were
	  not honoured.  - A few more bits and pieces for soundAlign
	  animation.

2005-04-25 12:58  jackjansen

	* Don't attempt to load background images if there is no layout
	  section.

2005-04-22 16:40  jackjansen

	* Unfinished (and disabled) code for animating soundAlign.

2005-04-22 16:39  jackjansen

	* Fixed logic error that caused mediaAlign to override regPoint and
	  regAlign but only on nodes, not on regions.

	  Fixes #1186546.

2005-04-22 16:37  jackjansen

	* Contents of this (generated) file accidentally got lost.

2005-04-22 15:28  jackjansen

	* Got fullscreen transitions to work on windows.

2005-04-22 15:27  jackjansen

	* Fixed boundary condition error in clockwipe: with progress=1.0 it
	  produced the same output as with progress=0.0.

2005-04-22 14:11  jackjansen

	* Oops, the previous correction was wrong. Another attempt at not
	  freeing playables twice.

2005-04-22 14:02  keesblom

	* Coerrected the video timing

2005-04-22 11:00  keesblom

	* Bug #1185268 (HappyBirthday 4 images are delayed) seems solved.
	  Video processing took 100% CPU and add all events in front of
	  queue.  Adding a small delay in start_frame (callaing add_event)
	  seems the cure.

2005-04-21 16:47  jackjansen

	* Different approach at fullscreen transitions: handle them more
	  like normal transitions. Unfinished.

2005-04-21 16:46  jackjansen

	* When destroying a playable first remove it from our
	  administration, so we don't run the chance of attempting to
	  destroy it twice.

2005-04-19 16:51  jackjansen

	* Started on fullscreen transitions. The net effect so far is that
	  fullscreen transitions are completely ignored.

2005-04-19 14:21  jackjansen

	* Added DTDs.

2005-04-19 14:03  jackjansen

	* Got out-transitions to work for overlapping images.

2005-04-18 16:53  keesblom

	* Turned off spurious debugging, but the problems with
	  HappyBirthday remains.

2005-04-18 16:10  keesblom

	* Added some locking in ffmpeg::demux to get rid of segfault

2005-04-18 16:08  keesblom

	* 1- removed dumpPixmap for Zaurus 2- Attempt to get rid of
	  segfault by adding some locking, maybe too much    because in
	  HappyBirthday the in-transition of the four images after    the
	  initial song is delayed until the first video has finished (on
	  Linux)

2005-04-18 15:16  jackjansen

	* Temporary stopgap to make this compile on WinCE: basically
	  disabled local file caching. The 8-bit to 16-bit char conversions
	  is a bit too much work right now, and we're not using xerces on
	  wince anyway.

2005-04-18 14:59  jackjansen

	* Fixed get_local_datafile for windows to actually work:-)

2005-04-18 13:41  jackjansen

	* Implemented get_local_datafile for windows.

2005-04-18 12:52  jackjansen

	* Fixes to get things to compile again for WinCE.

2005-04-17 01:45  jackjansen

	* Minor additions.

2005-04-17 01:19  jackjansen

	* Added a note that our special exceptions to the GPL apply to our
	  code only, not to the packages Ambulant may be linked against.

2005-04-17 00:23  jackjansen

	* Rewrapped so it is readable at an 80 column screen.

2005-04-16 23:36  jackjansen

	* Added a note that for the mac binary distribution you want to
	  build with xerces support in a plugin (make install fixes up the
	  plugin for the xerces library location but not the main
	  executable).

2005-04-15 14:52  jackjansen

	* Implemented better memory management in databuffer, thereby
	  getting rid of quite a few memcpy calls. get_read_ptr/readdone
	  and get_write_ptr/pushdata must now be paired.

	  Also, size() checks that it is not called between
	  get_read_ptr/readdone, but I'm not 100% sure yet that that is the
	  correct thing to do.

2005-04-15 14:45  keesblom

	* 1- updated ChangeLog & README-Distribution for the 1.4 release 2-
	  removed bug in datafile caching 3- changed URL for SMIL 2.1 to
	  current value in official W3C doc

2005-04-15 10:42  jackjansen

	* - Got rid of debug code (picture dumping).  - Removed a line that
	  caused a resampler to be created whether it	was needed or not.

2005-04-14 17:19  koelimoe

	* fixed the shaky video with a simple hack & added a factory
	  function for rtsp video

2005-04-14 16:46  jackjansen

	* Got cached DTDs to work on OSX.  Slightly changed the API for
	  finding the cached documents.  Fixed the installation of the
	  DTDs.

2005-04-14 16:03  keesblom

	* Updated for release 1.4

2005-04-14 15:35  keesblom

	* Reset  AMBULANT_VERSION back to 1.3, because its supposed to be
	  the last thing to do before actually creating the distribution

2005-04-14 15:17  keesblom

	* Updated AMBULANT_VERSION to 1.4

2005-04-14 14:50  jackjansen

	* Merging exp-jack-bgimage branch:

	  SMIL 2.1 backgroundImage and backgroundRepeat implemented on
	  Windows and MacOSX. On Linux things have been disabled, there are
	  still some problems to be solved.

2005-04-14 14:45  koelimoe

	* iadded the rtsp stream adressen

2005-04-14 14:35  koelimoe

	* Usage instructions for testing ambulant with rtsp support build
	  in

2005-04-14 14:34  koelimoe

	* added instructions to use live (rtsp streaming library) with
	  AmbulantPlayer

2005-04-14 14:14  keesblom

	* Optimized local datafile caching by using std::map::find(url) to
	  get the absolute path to a local datafile for a given url.

2005-04-13 13:56  koelimoe

	* addapted the configure/makefile setup for the live.com media
	  libraries. (rtsp support)

2005-04-12 14:18  koelimoe

	* fixed the sound for video. (added code so a decoder_datasource is
	  used for the audio)

2005-04-11 17:41  keesblom

	* Implemented DTD caching for Linux. Added SMIl 2.0 and SMIL 2.1
	  DTD files.  A file "ampping.txt" defines how the requested URLs
	  are to be mapped to local files. Only meaningfull when using
	  xerces parser.

2005-04-05 14:08  koelimoe

	* merged the rtsp brange

2005-04-04 16:15  jackjansen

	* More bits and pieces for background images.

2005-04-04 16:13  jackjansen

	* Added a new sytnchronization primitive: condition.

	  Currently only implemented on Unix/MacOS.

2005-04-04 11:47  jackjansen

	* Merging exp_jack_erasenever branch: - erase=never works on
	  Linux/Mac - Started on background images.

2005-03-31 14:02  keesblom

	* Repaired the empty <body> & empty <seq> bug.	Removed some
	  debugging cruft from qt_transition.cpp

2005-03-23 13:32  keesblom

	* Joined the audioFade branch with the trunk.

2005-03-21 15:45  jackjansen

	* std::string::c_str result is only valid for as long as the
	  std::string exists. Cater for that.

2005-03-21 15:34  jackjansen

	* Apparently region_info can be NULL (?), insulate against that.

2005-03-16 14:41  jackjansen

	* Added missing USE_SMIL21 ifdefs.

2005-03-08 11:58  keesblom

	* Some cleanup and a few minor memory leaks

2005-03-08 11:56  jackjansen

	* Fixed a bug that (somehow?) caused fill=transition not to end.

2005-03-07 16:28  jackjansen

	* Fix for #1158271: terrible hiss when playing back some audio
	  (notably birthday).

2005-03-07 15:20  jackjansen

	* Fullscreen transitions are working, at the cost of taking screen
	  snapshots at every redraw.

2005-03-07 13:52  jackjansen

	* Added _getOnScreenImage helper method.

2005-03-04 13:21  jackjansen

	* Fullscreen transitions start to do the right thing. Only,
	  unfortunately, to the background in stead of to the "old bits".

2005-03-03 16:25  jackjansen

	* Fullscreen transition information/steps are now communicated to
	  the toplevel AmbulantView.

2005-03-03 15:35  jackjansen

	* Something happens to all the toplevel window bits during a full
	  screen transition. It is far from correct, but at least it is
	  something:-)

2005-03-03 13:08  jackjansen

	* Implemented the platform-independent part of
	  fullScreenTransitions.  Unfortunately this is the easy part:-)

2005-03-02 15:30  keesblom

	* Reset event priorities to the original scheme: high - scheduler
	  related events med  - continuous media events low  - all other
	  events This scheme needs refinement, e.g. static media should be
	  renderered before continuous media when scheduled simulateously,
	  but once e.g. audio has really started, it should have fairly
	  high priority, to avoid hick-ups, but lower priority than user
	  events, so that the user has ultimate control.

2005-03-02 14:43  jackjansen

	* Fixed a couple of potential race conditions helgrind found.

2005-03-02 13:48  jackjansen

	* Got Cocoa video transition to work (when using the
	  datasource-based renderer, not the QuickTime renderer).

2005-03-01 17:54  keesblom

	* Merged with trunk: transition reorganization

2005-02-28 14:23  jackjansen

	* Fixed most glaring errors in datasource-based video renderer. The
	  colors are still of, though, because video-datasource returns
	  them as BGRA in stead of RGBA.

2005-02-25 16:35  jackjansen

	* Moved a lot more generic code into renderer_playable.  Made
	  cocoa_fill_renderer a subclass of cocoa_renderer.  This has made
	  cocoa_fill_renderer pretty small, and lots of methods in other
	  renderers have gone too.

2005-02-25 14:57  jackjansen

	* Factored cocoa_renderer so it now has a class that does the work,
	  cocoa_transition_renderer, and a glue template class.

2005-02-24 17:55  keesblom

	* Added Reload and "Load settings". Dumps core on Zaurus.

2005-02-22 17:33  keesblom

	* More AM_DBG turned off, NLS turned on again

2005-02-22 16:40  keesblom

	* Turned off AM_DBG and image dumps

2005-02-22 16:11  keesblom

	* in/out tranistions now work combined with smil animation fixed
	  the size of video

2005-02-21 14:28  jackjansen

	* Commented out unused transition support.

2005-02-21 14:26  jackjansen

	* Silly mistake in renderer implementations: transition_info's are
	  not owned by the renderer (they're global objects), so don't
	  delete them on cleanup.

2005-02-21 13:44  jackjansen

	* Fixed fill=transition behaviour.

2005-02-17 16:20  keesblom

	* Repaired a bug that caused a strange transition in Flashlight-CE
	  The region of the image drawn was to big

2005-02-17 11:37  keesblom

	* Made simultaneous in/out transitions work.

2005-02-16 17:26  jackjansen

	* iFixed three bugs in polygon and polylist transitions: -
	  Coordinates weren't converted to screenspace (from region-space)
	  - The origin on the "new" image was not used - The "old" image
	  was bitblitted too, which is unnecessary

2005-02-16 17:13  jackjansen

	* Polygon transitions weren't translated correctly to screen
	  coordinates.

2005-02-16 16:38  jackjansen

	* Fix for #1079403: fill=transition elements are never removed.
	  Unfortunately the fix means an incompatible change to the
	  interface for surface: it is not allowable to call
	  transition_done() while inside redraw(). Linux and Windows need
	  fixes for this, or they will hang on a mutex on transition end.

2005-02-16 09:57  koelimoe

	* added some methods

2005-02-15 12:43  koelimoe

	* design for the demux datasoures

2005-02-14 13:34  keesblom

	* Quick bug repair: default text didn't show if font or size was
	  not set

2005-02-11 15:28  keesblom

	* Merging branch containing  out transitions for qt with trunk

2005-02-09 16:58  jackjansen

	* Upped version number to 1.3.

2005-02-09 16:49  jackjansen

	* Upped version number to 1.3.

2005-02-09 16:48  jackjansen

	* Implemented volume and balance.

2005-02-08 15:57  jackjansen

	* Added missing file.

2005-02-08 15:55  jackjansen

	* The added "const" to the transition_info caused quite a bit of
	  havoc on windows...

2005-02-08 15:05  jackjansen

	* Added explicit transition methods.

2005-02-08 14:48  jackjansen

	* Fixed broken transitions (due to a change in a method signature).
	  Also made sure this "cannot happen" again, by getting rid of the
	  default do-nothing implementation. The drawback is that any
	  renderer not implementing transitions will have to provide its
	  own do-nothing methods.

2005-02-08 14:16  jackjansen

	* More compiler nits fixed.

2005-02-07 17:19  jackjansen

	* Make a difference between default audio placement and mid
	  placement.

2005-02-07 17:17  jackjansen

	* Fixed some compiler pickyness and other bugs in the new code.

2005-02-07 17:11  jackjansen

	* Added option --enable-smil21 (default: enabled) which governs
	  support for SMIL 2.1.

2005-02-07 16:35  jackjansen

	* Implemented soundAlign. Works for Mac (and probably Linux) except
	  for inheriting soundAlign from your region.

2005-02-07 15:39  jackjansen

	* Implemented SMIL 2.0 soundLevel attribute, which hadn't been done
	  yet. Platform independent code and SDL renderer done.

2005-02-07 00:03  jackjansen

	* Implemented meetBest. Untested.

2005-02-06 23:30  jackjansen

	* - Getting default regPoint/regAlign values from the region was
	  not implemented.    Fixed.  - Implemented SMIL 2.1 mediaAlign
	  attribute, overriding regPoint/regAlign.

2005-02-04 16:36  jackjansen

	* SMIL 2.1 paramGroup is starting to work, but not complete yet.

2005-02-04 15:52  jackjansen

	* Implemented <params> for qt text rendering.

2005-02-04 14:26  jackjansen

	* Added params implementation, but not used yet for wince (due to
	  code complexity).

2005-02-04 14:20  jackjansen

	* Implemented <param> for text objects on Windows.

2005-02-03 15:50  jackjansen

	* Changed <param> names to css-compatible.

2005-02-03 15:07  keesblom

	* Merged with branch: dur,startProgress and endProgress now work
	  for in-transitions.

2005-02-01 16:41  jackjansen

	* Fixed various issues with recent changes when building on
	  Windows.

2005-02-01 16:18  jackjansen

	* Re-enabled the url- and file-based parsers: the Windows player
	  uses them.  And it cannot be converted to do without them easily:
	  there are not enough datasource implementations for windows yet.

2005-02-01 15:55  jackjansen

	* Added fontName and fontSize parameters (in addition to
	  fontColor).

2005-02-01 15:54  jackjansen

	* Adapted for new parser driver signature.

2005-01-27 13:51  keesblom

	* Various refinements in parser error handling: - Made changes in
	  log_level settings take immediate effect - Added filename in
	  parser error messages - More uniform treatment of error messages
	  from expat and xerces - Disabled some functions that do not work
	  properly (e.g. build_tree_from_url)

2005-01-26 16:44  jackjansen

	* Added (minimal) support for SMIL 2.0 <param>. Only one parameter
	  (fontColor) is implemented, and only on one platform (Mac). A few
	  more will follow later.

2005-01-17 18:26  keesblom

	* Merged the branch containing the new event processor with the
	  main trunk

2005-01-13 16:39  jackjansen

	* Priorities to add_event are no longer optional.

2005-01-13 16:10  jackjansen

	* Not sure... May be last-minute fixes for the 1.2 distribution...

2005-01-13 16:09  jackjansen

	* The priority argument to add_event is no longer optional.

2005-01-13 15:18  keesblom

	* Event priorities revisited (Part I). Strategies: 1. No default
	  priorities (was: low). They need to be carefully designed.  2.
	  For now:	  - User (mouse) & System (update) events: high   -
	  renderer (audio, video) events: med	- all others: low 3. More
	  elaborated strategies likely to come.

2005-01-13 15:07  jackjansen

	* ome codecs (pcm, notably) will convert any amount of audio you
	  pass in and don't check AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE. Cater for
	  this by never passing in more than AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE/2
	  bytes. It's a heuristic, but let's hope it'll work.

2005-01-12 14:13  koelimoe

	* small fixes for ffmpeg 0.4.9

2004-12-24 17:15  keesblom

	* Turned off AM_DBG

2004-12-23 16:45  keesblom

	* Last Zaurus related changes for the 1.2 release.

2004-12-23 12:43  jackjansen

	* Two more version strings

2004-12-23 12:42  jackjansen

	* Use strip -x, not strip -X.

2004-12-21 11:57  koelimoe

	* mall modification to make it more clear what to do to build the
	  win32 player with or without xerces

2004-12-20 17:30  keesblom

	* Added more complete information for installing Ambulant on
	  Zaurus.

2004-12-20 16:56  jackjansen

	* Don't use ".tgz" for the source distribution, winzip doesn't like
	  it.

2004-12-20 14:09  jackjansen

	* More files that have version information.

2004-12-20 13:35  keesblom

	* For <brush> get the color from the attribute (bg_display_color is
	  undefined).

2004-12-20 13:11  jackjansen

	* Fixed some typos and reflowed.

2004-12-20 12:49  jackjansen

	* Added missing files and updated.

2004-12-20 12:17  keesblom

	* Restored old version of open_web_browser() to close Bug#1087096

2004-12-20 10:52  koelimoe

	* added a remark about xerces

2004-12-17 17:10  jackjansen

	* <a actuate="onLoad"/> anchors should appear in the timegraph, but
	  only those. Added a workaround to make this happen.

2004-12-17 15:30  jackjansen

	* Squashing debug output.

2004-12-17 15:30  jackjansen

	* More detailed information on where version numbers are to be
	  found.

2004-12-17 15:21  jackjansen

	* One more string.

2004-12-15 10:43  koelimoe

	* added some possible advertising options

2004-12-14 16:47  koelimoe

	* small corrections

2004-12-14 10:44  koelimoe

	* added more story about uploading new releases.

2004-12-13 17:07  jackjansen

	* Put the output in the bin/wince directory.

2004-12-13 17:04  jackjansen

	* Copy jpeg DLL too.

2004-12-13 16:50  koelimoe

	* started adding stuff to the upload section

2004-12-13 16:30  keesblom

	* Corrected an error in setting up clipping region for polylist

2004-12-13 15:48  koelimoe

	* set version number to 1.2

2004-12-13 14:54  jackjansen

	* Upped version number

2004-12-13 14:45  jackjansen

	* The code to get an event to the main event loop was broken, and
	  therefore inter-document links didn't work.

	  Fixed.

2004-12-13 14:43  jackjansen

	* Upped version number

2004-12-13 13:15  koelimoe

	* removed a typo i made from the configure.in

2004-12-13 13:04  koelimoe

	*  fixed bug 1082170. dummy plugin be optional

2004-12-13 13:00  koelimoe

	* this time for realy, added a forgtten ;

2004-12-13 12:59  koelimoe

	* added a forgotten ;

2004-12-10 10:22  jackjansen

	* For zlib and libpng build the DLL versions of the library, as
	  this is what the copy script and the Ambulant projects expect to
	  use.

2004-12-09 23:29  jackjansen

	* "a" style anchors were pretty much ignored. Make them behave more
	  or less like "area" anchors. I'm not 100% sure this is a good
	  idea, I seem to remember there was special-case code for "a"
	  anchors. But then I would have expected them to be caught by the
	  scheduler (in stead of being passed to playable_factory).

2004-12-09 22:56  jackjansen

	* Set default for loglevel to SHOW.

2004-12-09 22:55  jackjansen

	* If the user preference for parser is "any" we use the default
	  parser.  Usually this is the (fast) expat parser, but it has the
	  advantage of keeping the default default at "any", which will
	  also work if the player was configured with only xerces.

2004-12-09 22:53  jackjansen

	* Automatically show the log window at startup if and only if log
	  level has been set to debug.

2004-12-09 17:10  jackjansen

	* Notes on how to build the various installers.

2004-12-09 16:33  jackjansen

	* More notes (on uploading, website and advertising). Unfinished.

2004-12-09 16:14  jackjansen

	* Added a note about testing defaults.

2004-12-09 16:12  jackjansen

	* - Added a note about localisation checking - Added a note about
	  version number checking

2004-12-09 15:53  jackjansen

	* Unified Daniel and Jack's instructions for xerces.

2004-12-09 15:02  jackjansen

	* Lots of fixes/additions to readme files.

2004-12-09 14:28  koelimoe

	* updated the third_party_packages readme.txt

2004-12-09 13:24  keesblom

	* During waterfallWipe transition, the picture was accidently
	  translated twice.

2004-12-08 17:19  jackjansen

	* Gross hack to copy libxerces into the .app bundle.

2004-12-08 16:58  jackjansen

	* Started on the "What's new" section.

2004-12-08 16:04  keesblom

	* Attempt to generate one error message in a pop-up message box for
	  the end user, at the highest (but dumbest) level; detail
	  information is in the trace now.

2004-12-08 15:48  jackjansen

	* Microsoft makes lots of crappy software, but the HTML Help
	  Workshop stands out even in that company.

	  I finally got something resembling a working helpfile by copying
	  the html pages into the dir where the HHC file is, and changing
	  the names to local ones. Still, I can't get rid of the empty
	  index (nor fill it with anything).

2004-12-08 14:28  jackjansen

	* Removed debug.

2004-12-08 14:24  keesblom

	* Typo found and corrected by Jack on my desktop

2004-12-08 14:02  jackjansen

	* The scheduler can set the clock back under some circumstances,
	  causing the video renderer to stop rendering. Fixed by having the
	  video renderer allocate a new, private, clock.

2004-12-08 13:58  jackjansen

	* Don't hide active_video_renderer methods.

2004-12-08 13:56  jackjansen

	* INCLTDL and LIBLTDL aren't automatically substituted, so use
	  AC_SUBST().

2004-12-07 23:16  keesblom

	* Replaced the ugly mechanism to wait for a GUI message until OK'd
	  by the user by a pthread condition variable based implementation

2004-12-07 16:20  keesblom

	* Added line number to xerces error message. The format is now
	  e.g.: Parse error line 49: Unknown element 'tex' The upper layers
	  (gui, document handler) still produce their own error messages
	  when no input file is available, I think they should disappear,
	  but only if their is a guarantee that the parsers always deliver
	  proper error messages on parse errors (no error message is worse
	  than too many error messages).

2004-12-06 17:22  keesblom

	* Added a mechnism to avoid error messages getting stacked on top
	  of each other.

	  It works by calling m_lock->enter() before just before sending
	  the message to the gui thread, and calling m_lock->leave() in the
	  gui thread after the message has been displayed. Meanwhile the
	  calling thread again calls m_lock->enter() to block himself; this
	  lock is immediately released as soon as he gets it.  This
	  mechanism is not used by the gui thread, so messages from this
	  thread are still stacked.

	  This mechanism has to be replaced by an implementation based on
	  conditional variables.

2004-12-06 17:12  jackjansen

	* Don't get duration of audio (which may not exist) for video
	  datasource.

2004-12-06 15:26  jackjansen

	* Added LT_AC_PROG_SED to forestall error.

2004-12-06 14:41  jackjansen

	* That fix wasn't good enough: we also need to refrain from calling
	  scheduler::exec iteratively. This may have adverse consequences
	  in other places, though...

2004-12-06 14:39  jackjansen

	* Re-enabled the NSAutoReleasePool in the logger output routine.
	  This makes a lot of messages about leaking objects disappear.

2004-12-06 14:22  jackjansen

	* Removed debug output.

2004-12-06 14:09  jackjansen

	* The scheduler could hog the CPU while waiting for continuous
	  media that finished later than expected. Temporarily fixed by
	  never letting the scheduler wait for events in the past. A real
	  fix would probably be to have a better look at the priorities.

2004-12-03 23:43  keesblom

	* Added a test m_player != NULL to prevent SEGV that occurred when
	  quitting after a garbage URL was typed

2004-12-03 16:42  keesblom

	* Resolved Bug #1037781 by printing an error message on stderr when
	  the argument file cannot be opened, then the player terminates
	  with exit code -1.  This indicates the calling environment (e.g.
	  a test script) something went wrong.

2004-12-03 16:22  koelimoe

	* merging the experimental_jack_get_dur branch

2004-12-02 19:06  koelimoe

	* removed some plugin leftover that wasn't suppose to be there

2004-12-02 16:09  jackjansen

	* Cleaned up some debug and error output.

2004-12-02 14:24  jackjansen

	* Got cocoa_audio playable back into working order. Unfortunately
	  it doesn't help with the navigation problems: same behaviour as
	  theSDL and Arts playables.

2004-12-02 14:23  jackjansen

	* Removed/fixed debug output.

2004-12-02 14:18  koelimoe

	* removed the qsound stuff

2004-12-02 14:16  koelimoe

	* removed the qsound stuff from the make file

2004-12-02 14:14  koelimoe

	* fixed a debug msg

2004-12-02 13:58  koelimoe

	* removed the directory plugin, since it was obsolete

2004-12-02 13:44  koelimoe

	* fixed bug, 1065223 Unix: preferences dialog incorrect

2004-12-02 12:50  jackjansen

	* Workaround for a bug in the OSX compiler (optimizer? linker?)
	  that caused plugins to crash.

2004-11-30 17:11  jackjansen

	* Started work on getting make dist/make distcheck to work.

2004-11-30 14:22  koelimoe

	* turned the logger window back on

2004-11-30 14:06  koelimoe

	* 1)  fixed memory leak in qt_video_renderer 2) fixed bug 1075194

2004-11-30 14:02  koelimoe

	* the old and correct gcc.h

2004-11-29 15:10  koelimoe

	* gcc 3.4 should be able to compile the player now

2004-11-29 13:37  koelimoe

	* xerces build in and xers plugin compile again.

2004-11-26 15:42  koelimoe

	*  bug fix for bug 1071585. it is a hack but it seems to work for
	  me

2004-11-26 13:08  keesblom

	* Made it work on the Zaurus. No xerces, no plugins.

2004-11-23 13:02  koelimoe

	* fixed a bug where the player crashes if m_src == NULL.  fixed a
	  bug in qt_video_player, qt_video_player lost the last picture it
	  showed so any redraw resulted in the disappearing of the image

2004-11-23 11:13  koelimoe

	*  Fixed bug 1054622 but it introduces some other issues that have
	  to be looked into (see bug 1071585)

2004-11-19 17:37  keesblom

	* Implemented linked documents. It doesn't work really as it should
	  do, but neither does the windows implementation, from which it
	  was copied.

2004-11-18 23:41  jackjansen

	* Fix (hack?) to make the preferences dialog show the correct
	  defaults when no previous settings have been made.

2004-11-18 15:19  keesblom

	* Added a test for QT_THREAD_SUPPORT to make posting QEvents
	  thread-safe

2004-11-18 14:13  keesblom

	* Forgot to remove call to QTextEdit->append(..), causing Async
	  reply errors

2004-11-18 11:52  jackjansen

	* - Added Help to the Help menu - Added helpfile to the installer -
	  Added desktop shortcut to the player (on Dicks request)

2004-11-17 17:50  keesblom

	* Added mechanism to send QCustomEvent's to the main event loop.
	  This is now used for show_message and logging in a window Async
	  reply errors from X are still observed, however, these are likely
	  related to video.

2004-11-17 16:52  jackjansen

	* A first stab at creating Windows help.

2004-11-17 16:08  koelimoe

	* [no log message]

2004-11-17 15:50  jackjansen

	* - Install the manpage - Install the documentation (into
	  $pkgdatadir) - Enable viewing the documentation from the player -
	  When looking for the welcome document also look in $pkgdatadir.

2004-11-17 15:05  jackjansen

	* Finished first draft of the help files.  Added help book to the
	  Mac player.

2004-11-17 13:09  koelimoe

	* sorry

2004-11-17 12:19  koelimoe

	* fixed null pointer bug

2004-11-17 12:15  koelimoe

	* fixed (i think :-) ) the uncoupled get_read_ptr/readdone bug. In
	  the process i fixed some errors that valgrind reported aswell.
	  Please report if one of the assertion i put in place to detect
	  this	fail. (It's still possible that the arts sound renderer
	  shows the same problem, so i'll check this)

2004-11-17 00:17  jackjansen

	* Starting on the Help file. Unfinished.

2004-11-15 17:16  keesblom

	* Merged with Jack's locality additions.

2004-11-15 15:07  jackjansen

	* Workaround (hack) to forestall spurious error message when using
	  the xerces parser: we allow factories to be NULL (and the plugins
	  cater for this), and early during startup we register plugins,
	  but only parser plugins.

2004-11-15 15:06  jackjansen

	* Make sure get_read_pointer()/readdone() and
	  get_write_pointer()/pushdata() calls are matched.

2004-11-15 13:24  jackjansen

	* More translations.

2004-11-15 11:51  jackjansen

	* Revamped UI to be more in line with Mac/Windows.

2004-11-15 11:50  jackjansen

	* Don't give an error if the default parser happens to be the one
	  the user asked for.

2004-11-15 11:00  koelimoe

	* removed a small bug where the player crashed if
	  databuffer.pushdata was called with 0 as argument.

2004-11-15 10:48  jackjansen

	* Fixed ifdef for l10n

2004-11-15 10:46  jackjansen

	* - Fixed ifdefs for gettext support - Allow localisations to live
	  in ~/.ambulant/locale - Got localization to work.

2004-11-12 16:13  jackjansen

	* Started on translating Unix gui.

2004-11-12 16:08  jackjansen

	* Tweak.

2004-11-12 16:04  koelimoe

	* made a warn a debug , i don't think it should popup

2004-11-12 15:59  koelimoe

	* This "fix" casued the player to lock , so i removed it again CVS
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2004-11-10 15:09  koelimoe

	* itweak

2004-11-10 15:08  koelimoe

	  think these should end up on the user screen anyway

2004-11-10 12:35  koelimoe

	* Added the xerces parser to the wndows player.  although the
	  windows player doesn't uses the factory construction for this .

	  instead of the do_validation.

2004-11-01 16:35  jackjansen

	* Added --with-xerces-plugin, which governs whether xerces support

	* first draft on a man page

2004-11-01 14:00  jackjansen

2004-10-29 10:10  jackjansen

	* Added a seek method.

2004-10-28 23:51  jackjansen

	* Defensive programming: - Got rid of playable_imp::seek():
	  playables not implementing seek should   add a dummy method
	  themselves. renderer_playable_dsall does this.  - Don't call
	  renderer_done() unless show() has been called.  - Fixed a few
	  error messages.

2004-10-28 16:56  koelimoe

	* we make things better ;-)

2004-10-27 16:13  keesblom

	* Disabled qt_logger, because it often gets into an X-server error
	  "async reply". There is a solution, which only works with
	  QT_THREAD_SUPPORT which we don't have. Therefore the bug report
	  remains open.

2004-10-27 11:41  koelimoe

	* added plugin preferenecs

2004-10-26 16:19  koelimoe

	*  switched off the qt_logger.

2004-10-14 16:11  jackjansen

	* Add win_trace_error(), and use that to show error messages that
	  seem to appear always (such as the IMedia error for audio on
	  Win2K).

2004-10-14 15:40  jackjansen

	* Parser_factory added.

2004-10-14 15:39  jackjansen

	* Oops - some of the static libraries got replaced by dynamic
	  libraries. Fixed.

2004-10-14 15:11  jackjansen

	* For some reason (different VC++ version??!?) an unrelated checkin
	  by Daniel caused an rc-file to be added to the build. And this
	  file doesn't exist, of course... Removed.

2004-10-14 14:55  jackjansen

	* Added factories argument to parser call. untested.

2004-10-12 17:06  koelimoe

	  amount of playables

2004-10-08 17:04  jackjansen

	* Merging branch exp_jack_pdfdocs: generate the design
	  documentation as PDF.

2004-10-06 13:27  jackjansen

	* Use preprocessor construct to determine expat version, so it also
	  works for cross-compiling.

	* Added #ifdef WITH_PLUGINS to disable plugins

2004-10-05 18:06  keesblom

	* Removed a turd.

2004-10-04 10:55  jackjansen

	* Fixed typo in expat test.

2004-10-02 22:04  jackjansen

	* If no --with-expat option is given then first see whether there's
	  a pre-installed expat that is good enough (>= 1.95.7).

	  Untested.

2004-10-02 21:45  jackjansen

	* On debian Qt is installed in /usr, and QTDIR isn't set. Cater for
	  this situation.

	  parser_factory to the working code

2004-09-27 15:00  keesblom

	* Changed the Qt class for the logger window to QTextEdit rather
	  than QTextView because the latter is marked "deprecated" in the
	  more recent versions of Qt.

2004-09-25 00:22  jackjansen

	* Finished the documentation (I hope:-).

2004-09-24 16:36  jackjansen

2004-09-24 00:59  jackjansen

	* Started on a walkthrough of how a document is played.

2004-09-24 00:15  jackjansen

	* Explain the structure of the Documentation subtree.

2004-09-24 00:08  jackjansen

	* Moved README-Distribution to the misc directory.

2004-09-24 00:06  jackjansen

	* Added Logger window, accesible through File menu

2004-09-23 16:40  jackjansen

	* More documentation.

2004-09-23 13:24  koelimoe

	* fixed my my losy code from yesterday

2004-09-23 00:18  jackjansen

	* More documentation.

2004-09-22 17:56  keesblom

	* Added a Qt gui to select Ambulant preferences, called "Settings"
	  on Linux

2004-09-22 16:35  koelimoe

	*  Started to create a parser_factory in preparation of the xerces
	  plugin

2004-09-21 14:14  jackjansen

	* Started on documenting our externally visible APIs.

2004-09-21 14:10  jackjansen

	* Got rid of silly argument to resolve().  Documented.

2004-09-21 13:47  jackjansen

	* aclocal.m4 should *not* be in CVS, it's dependent on thhe
	  automake version.  The gettext m4 directory should be passed to
	  the aclocal call, so it will be searched when creating
	  aclocal.m4.

2004-09-20 16:35  koelimoe

	* fixed arts

2004-09-20 14:33  koelimoe

	* tweaks

2004-09-20 14:27  koelimoe

	* addapted the plugins to the new factory struc

2004-09-20 14:14  jackjansen

2004-09-20 10:40  jackjansen

	* API for plugins changed.

2004-09-19 23:41  jackjansen

	* Updated to the current state of things.

2004-09-18 00:45  jackjansen

	* Got plugins to load on MacOSX. The main problem was (shame,
	  shame) that the application was stripped during install.

2004-09-18 00:23  jackjansen

	* Revamped plugin engine: it is now a singleton. Upon creation it
	  collects a list of plugin directories, loads plugins from them
	  and collects the pointers to the init routines. The method
	  add_plugins() now calls the init routines so the plugins can
	  register themselves with the factories.

	  Only very lightly tested.

2004-09-17 16:05  jackjansen

	* Merging experimental_internationalized branch: - Use gettext
	  library to localize user-visible strings (if available) - Enable
	  localization of Mac user interface - Implemented both for Dutch
	  (and a little Japanese)

2004-09-14 15:07  jackjansen

	* Started on getting plugins to work on OSX. Compiles, but doesn't
	  do anything yet.

	  Also implemented naming convention "libamplugin_" for plugins and
	  changed some messages.

2004-09-14 14:31  jackjansen

	* - Make arts plugin conditional (depending on WITH_ARTS) - Change
	  library names to be of the form libamplugin_xxxxx.la - build
	  modules as noinst in stead of lib. At least now there not
	  installed in $libdir. The downside is they're not installed
	  anywhere:-)

2004-09-13 16:23  koelimoe

	* structure needed to remove SDL from the qt_renderer

2004-09-10 13:57  koelimoe

	* switched off the debug info

2004-09-10 12:46  koelimoe

	* fixed : the arts plugin didn't say that it was ready, when end of
	  file occured

2004-09-10 11:39  koelimoe

	* fixed the problem with stalling the presentation

2004-09-10 05:49  jackjansen

	* Tweaks

2004-09-09 16:56  koelimoe

	* turned off blocking for the arts server. this does seem to
	  resolve the problem that the rest of the presentation stalls. But
	  no sound is playing

2004-09-09 13:31  koelimoe

	* added stop, pause, resume

2004-09-08 16:41  koelimoe

	* removed a stupid deadlock

2004-09-08 16:35  koelimoe

	* started to work on the arts plugin

	* Merging branch exp_kees_020904 (unix_preferences) with trunk

2004-09-06 15:32  koelimoe

	* uncommented the SDL stuff

2004-09-06 11:41  koelimoe

	* arts sound renderer works again. but still has a problem: it
	  holds up the rest of the presentation until the sound is
	  finnished.

2004-09-03 15:25  jackjansen

	* Added preferences.cpp

2004-09-03 14:07  jackjansen

	* Got the preferences dialog to work.

2004-09-03 11:49  jackjansen

	* Added skeleton for the preferences dialog. Doesn't do anything
	  yet, though.

2004-09-03 11:29  jackjansen

	* On Windows, save preferences in the registry.

2004-09-03 11:28  jackjansen

	* Added missing include for <string>

2004-09-02 16:53  jackjansen

	* Use strcmp, not strncasecmp. Attributes are case-dependent (and
	  moreover strncasecmp doesn't seem to exist on windows).

2004-09-02 13:03  jackjansen

	* Preferences GUI works, but we do need an ugly "apply" button
	  because I haven't found out how we can be notified of changes.

2004-09-01 23:57  jackjansen

	* - Changed strings prefs from char* to std::string to forestall
	  garbage collection problems - Fixed Mac support - Removed const
	  char* values that would get copied in every module including
	  preferences.h.

2004-09-01 15:06  keesblom

	* Changed enums into char* for preferences\n Added "auto" as a
	  valid attributevalue in region_node

2004-08-31 22:59  jackjansen

	* Apparently this file is important too:-)

2004-08-31 17:51  keesblom

	* Moved unix related preferences to unix_preferences as part of the
	  gui

2004-08-31 16:37  jackjansen

	* Preferences subclass that saves/loads through NSUserDefaults.

2004-08-31 16:36  jackjansen

	* Got an initial preferences dialog working (for the log level
	  only) with NSUserDefaultsController. Preferences are also saved
	  in the standard MacOS way.

2004-08-31 15:15  keesblom

	* Reorganized preferences code, seems to work properly

2004-08-31 14:22  jackjansen

	* Allow subclassing of the preferences singleton.

2004-08-31 13:48  jackjansen

	* Added a loglevel preference and a way to set the log level
	  through the UI.  Only implemented for the Mac right now.

	* Added preferences to control Xerces validating features

2004-08-30 17:17  jackjansen

	* Made it compile on my Linux office desktop

2004-08-27 12:55  jackjansen

	* Adapted for preferences.cpp and WITH_EXPAT define.

2004-08-27 11:20  jackjansen

	* Tweaked to make it compile on the Mac.

2004-08-27 10:32  koelimoe

	* Morning, afternoon, missing Makefile.am sigh. it friday and i
	  need a beer :-)

2004-08-26 16:55  koelimoe

	* Started fixing the arts_renderer.

2004-08-26 16:53  jackjansen

	* Getting command line build to work too.

2004-08-26 16:43  jackjansen

	* tweaks

2004-08-26 16:42  jackjansen

	* Added an (internal) DTD so xerces is happy parsing this document.

2004-08-26 16:25  koelimoe

	* Merged the experimental_plugin_daniel branch

2004-08-25 23:49  jackjansen

	* Log window starts to work, but there are still some malloc
	  problems.

2004-08-25 17:06  jackjansen

	* Added skeleton log window. It does everything, except displaying
	  the log:-)

2004-08-25 11:26  jackjansen

	* Various fixes to be able to use both parsers on MacOS - Some
	  stuff was inside #ifdefs but shouldn't be - Also allow parser
	  value ANY (means use either) - Set default parser with
	  environment variable AMBULANT_USE_PARSER

2004-08-24 14:31  keesblom

	* Temporary feature: player_unix/AmbulantPlayer can now select the
	  Xerces  XML parser by setting the environment variable
	  XMLPARSER=XERCES

2004-08-24 13:28  keesblom

	* Extended preferences to include parser selection (expat/xerces)

2004-08-23 15:44  jackjansen

	* Added a missing const

2004-08-23 14:52  jackjansen

	* - Added a show_message function pointer member to the logger,
	  which overrides   the default show_message, plus a
	  set_show_message to set it.  - In addition to writing to the log
	  also call show_message in case of   error or fatal logging
	  entries - For cocoa, use set_show_message and set_ostream to
	  override logger output.    The current cocoa implementation is
	  still a dummy (using NSLog).

2004-08-23 14:50  jackjansen

	* Plugged memory leak.

2004-08-23 10:46  jackjansen

	* Factored out duplicate code in constructor and reset(), thereby
	  fixing the latter.

	* Added an extra warning that Visual Studio 7.0 won't work.

2004-08-19 15:46  jackjansen

	* Note about where error messages can be found (which hadn't been
	  checked in due to an oversight).

2004-08-19 15:45  jackjansen

	* Fixed to allow building with either xerces, expat or both.

2004-08-19 15:44  jackjansen

	* Started on support for both xerces and expat.

2004-08-19 15:43  jackjansen

	* Added some notes on the xerces building process.

2004-08-19 14:17  jackjansen

	* Copied to main branch

2004-08-18 17:51  jackjansen

	* Started on supporting both expat and xerces in one binary.
	  Doesn't work yet:-)

2004-08-18 16:16  keesblom

	* Merging yesterday's branch into the trunk

2004-08-13 15:00  koelimoe

	* tweaks, sound works fine with ffmpeg 0.4.8 and 0.4.9pre1 but
	  video is still a problem with 0.4.9pre1

2004-08-09 13:31  koelimoe

	* Fixed the sound for ffmpeg-0.4.9.

2004-08-02 13:56  keesblom

	* ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1 support disabled, video's in Birthday are
	  broken.  Enable by uncommenting #define WITH_FFMPEG_0_4_9 (line
	  49 in ffmpeg_datasource.cpp).

2004-07-30 17:08  keesblom

	* Added support for ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1, using  #ifdef
	  WITH_FFMPEG_0_4_9 Welcome doesn't play sound, Demo does,
	  Flashlight video now works

2004-07-29 15:22  keesblom

	* Merging branch into main trunk

2004-07-27 16:26  keesblom

	* Added another test to prevent "realloc(...,0)", now in
	  "pushdata(sz)"

2004-07-23 17:25  jackjansen

	* - On linux realloc(..., 0) returns NULL, which is not an error.
	  - Also, if m_size is 0 we alsways realloc (as there is no copying
	  cost	 incurred)

2004-07-23 16:19  jackjansen

	* ffmpeg_video_datasource didn't clean up any remaining frames on
	  termination, fixed. Should fix #992376.

2004-07-23 16:04  jackjansen

	* There is now a new call set_max_unused_size() to signal when to
	  reclaim unused space.

	  In addition, there are class methods default_max_size(size) and
	  default_max_unused_size(size) that can be used to change the
	  defaults. These could be called on the handheld platforms to
	  limit the amount of memory used by databuffers in general.

2004-07-23 13:10  jackjansen

	* Added an explicit reference to where the player is installed and
	  what it is called.

2004-07-23 11:57  jackjansen

	* - Give an error message if no gui toolkit is found, unless an
	  explicit   --without-qt or similar is specified on the configure
	  call - Similar for ffmpeg.

	  Should fix #995861.

2004-07-21 14:57  jackjansen

	* Updated version number to 1.0.1 so we ourselves know what we're
	  running.  Let's update again to 1.0.2 for the next external
	  release.

2004-07-21 14:56  jackjansen

	* Handle URLs with numeric hostnames correctly.

2004-07-20 16:28  kleanthis

	* Prevent descendents of paused nodes to go active.

2004-07-19 16:57  kleanthis

	* Avoid re-entering the main scheduler loop. Leave any events for
	  the next iteration.  This should increase a lot the application's
	  stability when links fire.

2004-07-18 19:42  kleanthis

	* Re-enable slideWipe.	Attempt to optimize repainting of multiple
	  concurrent transitions.  Unfortunately this cannot be done due to
	  errors in the subregion redraw code.

2004-07-18 19:34  kleanthis

	* Small things here and there: Wait for the end of media event when
	  the implicit duration is involved in timing calculations.  Fix
	  repeat that was broken for some cases.

2004-07-16 22:40  kleanthis

	* Auto-start dropped docs.

2004-07-16 22:36  kleanthis

	* Some more refinements on pausing.

2004-07-16 17:58  keesblom

	* Cleanup, removed debug output, added installation directory for
	  the Welcome document

2004-07-16 16:53  kleanthis

	* Some more steps in integrating pause semantics into the model.
	  The first result is that the ref document LinkingOnly now seems
	  to play correctly.

2004-07-14 17:52  keesblom

	* Added tips and some (190) suppressions for installing and using
	  "valgrind ".

2004-07-13 23:30  kleanthis

	* Add a handy function "get_sig" that returns the string "tag[id]"
	  for use n logging statements. The "this" pointer used in many
	  places is almost useless.

2004-07-13 23:27  kleanthis

	* The timing was broken for documents containg 'a' anchors.  Fix
	  this by handling ''a" anchors as "area" elements.  Their lifetime
	  is now restricted by their parent and this fits better into the
	  smil timing model.  This fixes one of the many errors in
	  LinkingOnly.smil ref doc.

2004-07-13 23:24  kleanthis

2004-07-08 16:01  jackjansen

	* Added quotes around postbuild step filename, so this step also
	  works when there are spaces in the path leading up to the
	  ambulant source tree. Spotted by Sjoerd.

2004-07-08 14:42  jackjansen

	* Oops - winCE projects for third_party_packages were missing.
	  Fixed.

2004-07-07 16:08  keesblom

	* Rewrote README-ZAURUS completely now that it is easy to download
	  a complete "ipk" package and let the Zaurus Package Installer do
	  all the work.  The old text is now called HISTORY-ZAURUS. Also
	  the "ipk" package has been commited.

2004-07-06 13:56  jackjansen

	* Added files that were missing from the source distribution.

2004-07-06 13:14  keesblom

	* Removed QInputdialog for Zaurus

2004-07-05 16:58  jackjansen

	* Updated to 1.0 icon.

2004-07-05 16:34  jackjansen

	* Added "Open URL" dialog.

2004-07-05 15:53  jackjansen

	* Video renderer didn't call renderer_done() on stop. This could
	  lead to wild jumps later, when the region wants to do a redraw.
	  Fixes #974715.

2004-07-05 14:26  jackjansen

	* data: urls were handled incorrectly. fixed.

2004-07-05 14:25  jackjansen

	* Removed debug

2004-07-05 14:25  jackjansen

	* New icon

2004-07-05 14:24  jackjansen

	* Removed debug output

2004-07-05 14:24  jackjansen

	* Stopgap for fixing transition background: always recreate the
	  offscreen pixmap in which we render thhe data.

2004-07-05 13:52  jackjansen

	* Updated icons and about text.

2004-07-05 13:27  jackjansen

	* Added section on building ipk files.

2004-07-05 12:50  jackjansen

	* iRemoved debug output.

2004-07-05 11:36  jackjansen

	* Test CVS locking problem - ignore.

2004-07-05 11:33  jackjansen

	* CVS locking problem test, ignore.

2004-07-05 11:20  keesblom

	* Disabled QCursor for the Zaurus

2004-07-05 11:15  jackjansen

	* - Registry entry for double-clicking a smil document was wrong.
	  Fixed.  - Dick wants the two-level name structure in the start
	  menu back, and   I couldn't be bothered to argue:-)

2004-07-05 10:01  kleanthis

	* Set the resolution of the event processor to 50ms. Should be even
	  smaller. The previous value (100ms) was too large.

2004-07-05 09:58  kleanthis

	* Use the main event processor instead of the secondary for
	  transitions for smoother redraws.

2004-07-05 09:56  kleanthis

	* Disable slideWipe transitions until i provide a fix (i will
	  attempt to do this later today).

2004-07-04 15:46  kleanthis

	* Various small changes based on Dick's report a) Fixed version
	  string in the About box b) Changed check mark icon with the
	  notepad icon. Please design a better one and we can replace it c)
	  Some bogus URLs are catched d) Fixed load settings e) Verified
	  that opening by double click works. BUT requires the correct
	  registry entries. For example if the command is
	  [<home>\AmbulantPlayer"] instead of [<home>\AmbulantPlayer" "%1"]
	  the player will be opened by the filename will not be passed by
	  the system.

	* Define macro text_str if not defined just in case...

2004-07-02 12:37  kleanthis

	* A trick applicable only for wince in order to bypass compiler
	  shortcoming.

2004-07-02 12:35  kleanthis

	* Unicode and URL related changes.  The WinCE player compiles and
	  runs again.

	  documents over the net. Fixes 833702.

2004-07-01 14:50  kleanthis

	* Autostart documents passed through the schell. But keep the
	  mechanism just i case.

2004-07-01 14:26  kleanthis
