2013-12-11  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Get animation boundary values (from, to, etc) at time of animation
	start, not time of animation parse. This allows them to come from
	SMIL State variables.

	* Use top-srcdir, not srcdir, as anchor for include

2013-12-09  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* include is relative to top_srcdir

	* Added a forgotten reference to the new configure variable
	WITH_SDLPANGO

2013-10-31  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Minor fix

	* Try to make UDP fifo size larger

	* Bug fix to reference fix

	work

2013-10-18  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Produce a debug log message telling whether latency logging is on or
	off

2013-10-17  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* For live streams skip nonref frames if we have backlog in our input
	or output buffers

	* Adding #is_live=1 to URL will enable CODEC_FLAG_LOW_DELAY

2013-10-16  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

2013-09-10  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* datasource wasn't stopped before being released. Fixed.

2013-09-09  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Some changes to smil_state locking. May lead to deadlocks

2013-09-06  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Enable fixing of timestamps only for non-live streams.

	* Backout changeset 36f5457de03fc6beda4e53bca393dc5d924e813f

	can build ffmpeg in debug mode

2013-08-19  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	not perfect yet (but almost).

2013-08-18  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* implemented PanZoom for sdl_imgae by factoring out the scaling
	facility from sdl_video to sdl_window and re-using that in sdl_image

2013-08-17  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Turned of AM_DBG; removed some junk code.

	* Removed superfluous call to clear_sdl_surface().

	* Forgot some variable initializations.

2013-08-15  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added libjpeg-devel to prerequisites (used in Demos, e.g. Birthday)

	* Fixed bug due to recent addition of optonal audio recorder

	* Found more packages that AmbulantPlayer needs on Virgin Ubuntu (for
	SDL2).

	* Adapted INSTALL for more missing packages (partly due to SDL2)
	(found on Virgin Ubuntu).

	* Added missing include filoe, found by 'make distcheck'

	(aka. SDL2) and player_sdl.

	* Removed some compiler warnings

2013-08-14  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Combine packets when they have the same timestamp. This is needed to
	improve the quality of the fraunhofer H264 RTP streams. Unsure
	whether this is a problem with the fraunhofer streams, our code or
	ffmpeg, and also unsure whether this is a good idea in general. Need
	to test.

	* Removed old (17-feb-2010) code that invented timestamps for the
	incoming stream in case they were missing (AV_NOPTS). The code was
	causing problems with the Fraunhofer H264 live streams. I don't
	think the timestamp invention is needed (any more?), but we nedd to
	test that removing it doesn't have adverse consequences elsewhere.

2013-07-15  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Some code cleanup

2013-07-14  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Refined debug output; all names now start with gst_ambulant_src_ for
	easy find in debug output

2013-07-09  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Added support for automake silent rules, and turn them on. Disable
	with 'make V=1'

	* Disabled ffmpeg extensive debug output

	* Better error message, and dont include too many image libraries

2013-07-08  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* <stdin> is now dup'd, and the dup-fd is closed on a call to
	gstambulantsrc_stop(), to prevent the reader thread form hanging in
	read() when exit is requested.

2013-07-08  Jack Jansen  <Jack.Jansen@cwi.nl>

	* Minor cleanup

	* clear out m_event_processor during cleanup

	* Fixed a bug in initialisation

2013-06-30  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Refined the check for consistent width,height to remove incorrect
	error message on EOF when width,height are correctly specified as
	properties

	* Removed FRAME_DELAY_DEBUG code

	* Added a check that width,height do not change and match with
	possible values provided as properties

2013-06-28  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Replaced the property 'no-wait' by 'width' and 'height'; when both
	are set to a value > 0, the element works asynchronous, and while
	waing for initial input from <stdin>, it produces white frames of
	the specified size.

2013-06-25  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added a some comments why an initial frame may not be such a good
	idea, in its present form. Re-arranged come code as well.

	* Simplified pyambulant_recorder and added error checking when writing
	on the pipe.

2013-06-24  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	subsequent buffers

	* Redraw as early as possible

2013-06-18  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Rewrote ambulantsrc to a threaded implementation (no_wait=true)
	where an initital white screen is shown while waiting for data on
	stdin

2013-06-11  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added protection against crash of sws_scale when using a null
	src/dst rect.

2013-06-10  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Fixed bug, no more problems. Undid #8319. Real cause was: my wrong
	understanding what stride of the input picture really was.

2013-06-09  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Initializing swscale pixel outpu buffer seems to help, but doesn't
	fix every case

2013-06-06  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Fixed 'fit' attribute for SDL video for most values
	(hidden,meet,fill,slice)

2013-06-05  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* First step sdl_video scaling: gret rid of multiple images. Does not
	scale yet.

	* Make the trace messages during plugin loading more consistent

	* Fixed a bug in last change (ignore '.pyc' files): C++ compare has
	the same semantics as C compare.

2013-06-04  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Found a bug in Makefile.am causing the python recorder plugin not to
	be distributed when --with-python was selected.

	some debug output

	* Ignore '.pyc' files

	* When installing, remove possibleleft-over '.pyc' files

2013-06-02  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added a threaded implementation to write data in a separate thread

2013-05-31  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added a comment that the internal data format in the pipe connecting
	Ambulant and gstreamer through the recorder plugin always starts
	with an 80 byte header.

	* Only lock m_queue access, and when empty, use contiditional waiting
	to be waken

2013-05-30  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Changed to counting semaphore instead of busy-wait polling loop

2013-05-30  Kees Blom  <Kees.Blom@cwi.nl>

	* Fixed bug s.t. last frame is never shown

2013-05-29  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Added smaal debugging tool for recorder.

2013-05-28  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

2013-05-15  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Adapted to changes in 8299.

2013-05-14  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* Fulshing the pipe after a frame has been written.

	* In addition printing complete clocktime adter reading new data, also
	print this info before the pipe is read.

	* Changed the interval between subsequent coloured frames from 1 to 2
	sec.each.

	* get_times() now returns the correct values for start,stop times from
	the buffer given as an argument.

2013-05-13  Kees Blom  <kees@cwi.nl>

	* added #ifdef FRAME_DELAY_DEBUG to be set by adding
	CXXFLAGS=-DFRAME_DELAY_DEBUG

	* Added unlock during fread. Does not help, but is a good idea,
	nervertheless.

	* Simplified code s.t. 'make check' find the plugin at the spot they
	were build

	* Simplified code s.t. 'make check' find the plugin at the spot they
	were build

	* During 'make check' find the plugin at the spot they were build

	* Added a line to work with gstreamer-1.0

	* added #ifdef FRAME_DELAY_DEBUG to be set by adding
	CXXFLAGS=-DFRAME_DELAY_DEBUG

2013-05-07  Kees Blom  <Kees.Blom@cwi.nl>

	* Added an optional print, enable by: ./configure
	CFLAGS=-DFRAME_DELAY_DEBUG

	* Forgot include file in dist

	* Various changes to investigate (and hopefully improve) frame delay

	* Adapted test1.sh to the new version of test1.smil

	* Adapted test2 to the new version of plugin

	* Forgot include file in dist

	* Forgot include file in dist

	* Changed test1.smil s.t. it shows fullscreen red,green,blue,white, 1
	second each.

2013-05-06  Kees Blom  <Kees.Blom@cwi.nl>

	* some minor tweaks

2003-12-12  Kleanthis Kleanthous  <kleanthis@sf.net>

	* Parse any list of types for which a parselet exists.

	* After a lot of experimentation on parsing attributes, the "keep it
	simple" principle won. My conclusion is that attribute parsing can
	be done more easily using a set of atomic parsers that can be
	combined in various ways to form more complex ones. The regex (nfa)
	approach seems not to be best vehicle for our needs. Currently an
	nfa-based parser is also provided but future versions may remove
	this support along with all the nfa stuff.

2003-12-12  Daniel Benden  <koelimoe@sf.net>

	* Include stdio.h for sprintf.

	* Simplify list content for g++ 2.95

	* Define operator== for lhs a string and rhs a const char* for g++
	2.95
