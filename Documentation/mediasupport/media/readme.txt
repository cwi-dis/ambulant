These audio/video files are intended to test Ambulant media playback
compatibility. Because creating these can be difficult, and also because
there may be slight differences among codecs about the various specs, here
are the details of how these files were encoded.

NOTE: these files are not intended to judge the quality of the various
encodings, only whether they work at all. Some have gone through a number
of intermediate conversions, wrecking quality.

Please keep this file up-to-date when adding new formats.
