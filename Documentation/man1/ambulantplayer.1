.SH DESCRIPTION
.B AmbulantPlayer
The AMBULANT Open SMIL Player is an open-source, full SMIL 2.0 media player. It is intended for researchers and developers who want an source-code player upon which they can build higher-level systems solutions for authoring and content integration, or within which they can add new or extended support for networking and media transport components. The AMBULANT player may also be used as a complete, multi-platform media player for applications that do not need support for closed, proprietary media formats.
