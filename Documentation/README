This directory contains various bits and pieces of documentation.

The subdirectories and their contents are as follows:

Design has documentation on the overall design of the Ambulant Player,
plus notes on code organization, source code conventions, etc.

API has the detailed documentation of all the interfaces and classes
we consider public. Or, actually, it has only a Doxyfile: download Doxygen
from <http://www.doxygen.org/> to regenerate it yourself.

misc has various bits and pieces of information we want to keep together,
and that may or may not be relevant to you: how we create distributions,
how to install the Zaurus cross-development tools, etc.
