How to use LIVE.COM
====================


Live.com comes with a set small programs to test rtsp streaming with. To
test AmbulantPlayer with rtsp use the testOnDemandRTSPServer program,
you can find this in .../live/testProgs. This litle test server uses for
each filtype it supports a file called test.ext (where ext is the ext
assosiated with the file type)

For CWI use:
I have testOnDemandRTSPServer running on noorwegen.cst.cwi.nl (only
reachable from inside CWI) broadcasting the files (found in my home
directory):
    Ambulant/ambulant/third_party_packages/live/testProgs/test.mp3
	Ambulant/ambulant/third_party_packages/live/testProgs/test.mpeg
To play the streams use:
	 rtsp://192.16.191.118:8554/mp3AudioTest
	 rtsp://192.16.191.118:8554/mpeg1or2AudioVideoTest

The directory testmovie (again in my home dir.) contains a couple of
test smil files:
	rtsp.smil plays test.mp3 over rtsp. (audio only)
	rtsp_video.smil plays test.mpeg over rtsp (video & audio)

For others:
- Create a directory with files test.mp3, test.mpeg and whatever other
  media types you want to serve.
- run live/testProgs/testOnDemandRTSPServer here.
- create a .smil that references rtsp://localhost/mp3AudioTest
  (or any of the other names mentioned in the source for
  testOnDemandRTSPServer).
