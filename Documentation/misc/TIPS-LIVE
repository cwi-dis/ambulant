How to use LIVE.COM
====================


Live.com comes with a set small programs to test rtsp streaming with.
To test AmbulantPlayer with rtsp use the testOnDemandRTSPServer program, 
you can find this in .../live/testProgs. This litle test server uses for 
each filtype it supports a file called test.ext 
(where ext is the ext assosiated with the file type)

For CWI use:
I have testOnDemandRTSPServer running on noorwegen.cst.cwi.nl broadcasting the files :
    /ufs/dbenden/Ambulant/ambulant/third_party_packages/live/testProgs/test.mp3
	/ufs/dbenden/Ambulant/ambulant/third_party_packages/live/testProgs/test.mpeg
The directory /ufs/dbenden/testmovie contains a couple of test smil files:
	rtsp.smil plays test.mp3 over rtsp. (audio only)
	rtsp_video.smil plays test.mpeg over rtsp (video & audio)
