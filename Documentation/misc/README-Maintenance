Various project maintenance aspects.
====================================

This document serves to record various (sometimes hidden)
internal project maintenance aspects.
Currently it is alsmost empty. Potential topics could be:
- user management (CWI, Sourceforge, Oratrix)
- backups
- bug management
- regression testing

Backups.
========

User ambulant on bahco.sen creates a nightly mirror backup of the
entire Sourgeforge repository after updating and commiting ChangeLog.
The scripts for these hidden action are in: /ufs/ambulant/scripts
(update_changelog.sh and backup.sh) and are enabled to run at night
by the command: crontab -e.
