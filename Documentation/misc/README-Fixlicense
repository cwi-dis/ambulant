How to fix the license
======================

If you need to fix the license of all the sourcefiles here's a method that
more-or-less worked for me:

1. Check out a clean copy of the repository.

1a. Temporarily make .hg (or whatever) mode 0.

2. Make a list of all files that should have the license. Grepping for something
   like that should be in those files worked for me:
   
    % find . -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l "Ambulant Player is free software" > @files
   
3. Make a similar list of all files that have "copyright" in them:

    % find . -print0 | xargs -0 grep -li "copyright" > @files2
    
4. Compare the two lists, make sure that anything in the second list but not
   in the first one is indeed not part of Ambulant. There should only be a few
   (slurped files, diffs, etc).
   
5. Remove all the old licenses:

    % fixlicense.py -r < @files
    
6. Note all files about which fixlicense complains, and remove the licenses here
   manually. This will be accidental edits in the license, etc.
   
7. Adapt fixlicense.py to the new license text.

8. Add the new license:

    % fixlicense.py -a < @files
    
9. If the change was only a date change such as (c) 2003-2005 to (c) 2003-2006
   you are done. Otherwise you should manually inspect things like .rc files.
   Grep for "LGPL" or some such keyword.
   
10. The file "COPYING" in the top directory may need to be edited manually.
