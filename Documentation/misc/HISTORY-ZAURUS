How the Ambulant implementation on Sharp SL-5600 Zaurus.was done.
================================================================

Starting point was a technical document by Sharp titled
"Sharp SL-series Zaurus Qtopia Development Start-up Guide"
available on-line at:
"www.zaurus.com/dev/support/downloads/qte_programming-guide_v111.pdf"

Not all utilities discussed in that paper were used. The tools "qmake",
"tmake", "qvfb" and "uic" were skipped, to minimize dependencies of
our environment and Qt. The only utility we really needed from them is
"moc" (meta-object-compiler) which glues various GUI components together.

Some information in that document is out-of-date, the "qtopia 1.5.0"
build environment is no longer available at www.trolltech.com, but at:
"http://community.zaurus.com/projects/qtopia-sdk"
This environment is necessary since it matches the factory installed
software on the device. The installed RPM was:
qtopia-free-1.5.0-1.i386.rpm
This RPM installs in "/opt/Qtopia".

For cross-compilation, the needed RPM's were taken from the Sharp
developer website: "http://www.zaurus.com/dev/tools/other.htm".
The following RPM's were downloaded and installed:
gcc-cross-sa1100-2.95.2-0.i386.rpm
glibc-arm-2.2.2-0.i386.rpm
binutils-cross-arm-2.11.2-0.i386.rpm
linux-headers-arm-sa1100-2.4.6-3.i386.rpm
These packages install in "/opt/Embedix/tools"

In the environment (window) in which the "configure;make" was
to obtain a cross-compiled AmbulantPlayer, PATH was prepended:

	export PATH=/opt/Qtopia/sharp/bin:/opt/Embedix/tools/bin:$PATH

Next set the environment variables QTDIR and QPEDIR to /opt/Qtopia
by: 
	export QTDIR=/opt/Qtopia
        export QPEDIR=/opt/Qtopia.
    
configure was done on a Linux-PC box as follows:
./configure --prefix=`pwd` --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux \
--with-qt  --with-qtopia --without-arts 

File transfer was done using the wireless connection.
To make the connection active, stay close to a transmitter.
Move "file" to be transferred to the place where your homepage
resides, then using the Qtopia browser on the PDA "file" can
be selected from your homepage environment and will be dumped in
"/home/zaurus/Documents/file." with its execution bits lost.
Type "cd /home/zaurus/Documents" followed by:
chmod +x file.
and start the program:
./file.


SDL On the Zaurus
=================

For SDL support on the zaurus you need to install the following
development packages :
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/SDL-dev-1.2.6cvs.tar.gz
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/SDL_mixer-dev-1.2.5cvs.tar.gz
and the following libraries on the zaurus :
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/feed/libSDL_1.2.6cvs-1_arm.ipk
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/feed/libSDL-mixer_1.2.5cvs-1_arm.ipk.

To enable SDL support, prepend the directory were the "sdl-config"
script was installed to you PATH and run configure with --with-sdl:

	export PATH=.../SDL/bin:$PATH
	./configure --prefix=`pwd` --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu \
	--host=arm-linux --with-qt  --with-qtopia --without-arts --with-sdl

ffmpeg on the Zaurus
====================

ffmpeg-0.4.8 was downloaded from ffmpeg.sourceforge.net and configured using
./configure --cpu=armv4l --cc=arm-linux-gcc --disable-mmx --prefix=`pwd` \
--enable-shared
Then "make" produced the needed libraries libavcodec/libavcodec.a and
libavformat/libavformat.a
