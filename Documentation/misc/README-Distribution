To make a distribution make sure you do :


Before creating the distribution :
==================================

- make sure your CVS tree is uptodate and that there are no uncommited files
- change the version number in configure.in and in include/ambulant/version.h 
- check the files README, README-ZAURUS, Extras/bindist-readme.txt
  and third_party_packages/readme.txt, if they need to be updated.
- You must update NEWS, give a high-level overview of what has changed.
- You must update Changelog. There is a tool cvs2cl that does this
  more-or-less automatically, something like the following command line should
  do the trick:
  
  % cvs log -b -d '>'2004-07-01 | cvs2cl.pl --stdout --stdin


To create the linux source distribution :
=========================================

- Use make distcheck
- If make distcheck complains about not being able to find expat, 
  you have to set the path to the expat library via the environment variable:
 
  DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--with-expat=third_party_packages/expat-unix \
	--with-arts"  make distcheck

--with-arts is needed here, otherwise the last part of "make distcheck"
will fail. It is the test whether or not the the tarball is self-contained,
and and the error message is cryptic: "Permission denied" when copying files.


Binary distributions :
======================

Binary distribution should contain the following files :

- bindist-readme.txt, the one in Extras
- the player binary, preferable staticly linked
- A demo presentation, provided by Dick.
- The GNU License
