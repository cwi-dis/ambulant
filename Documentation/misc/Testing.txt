Ambulant Acceptance testing.
---------------------------

This document attempts to lists all tests that need to be passed
before an Ambulant distribution can be considered thrustworty.
Since this goal ("all tests") can never be fully achieved, please add 
new tests to cover new features / bugs, or replace inadequate
tests with more appropriate ones.

Try to make these new tests as concise, yet as complete as possible.

----------------------------------

1. Download/Install/Run on a virgin machine:
   Welcome should play.
   Check if the menu's work properly.
   File->Open
       ->Open URL
       ->Reload
       ->Settings
       ->Quit
   Play->Play
       ->Pause
       ->Stop
   View->Full Screen (not yet implemented)
       ->Window
       ->Load Settings
       ->Log Window
   Help->About AmbulantPlayer
       ->AmbulantPlayer Help
       ->AmbulantPlayer Website
       ->Play Welcome Document
   Click on the link "www.ambulantplayer.org", an external
   web browser should start (on Linux, the environment
   variable BROWSER must be set, e.g. export BROWSER=firefox").

2. Download/Install/Run on a non-virgin machine (update).
   Select: "Help->Play Welcome Document" and repeat the
   menu check under 1. above.

3. Run the program with argument .../Extras/DemoPresentation/NYC-SMIL2.smil
   Let it run completely.
   Try "View->Load Settings" select MultiAudio.xml, and select
   Play->Stop,  Play->Play
   You should hear a background music now.

4. Select File->Open: NYC-MMS.smil
   The presentation is now done using lower quality audio and images.

5. Download and extract from www.ambulantplayer.org->Ambulant Player Demos
   Birthday Zip File
   Euros Zip File
   Flashlight Zip File
   News Zip File

6. Run the demo's:

   Birthday/HappyBirthday.smil
   Birthday/HappyBirthday-Big.smil
   Birthday/HappyCE.smil
      Try selection by clicking on one of the small pictures.
      The last one should also be playable on a device without video support.

   Euros/EUROshow.smil
   EURO-CE.smil
      Try selection by clicking on Next/Back buttons.

   Flashlight/Flashlight-Desktop.smil
      Try selection by clicking on the buttons in the left column.
   Flashlight/Flashlight-CE.smil
      Try selection by clicking on the buttons in the bottom row.
      Try "View->Load settings" and select USA-Market.xml
      You should hear a different voice and see different images where
      e.g. the word "Flashlight" is used instead of "Torch"

   News/Danes2-Desktop.smil
      Try select any news item by clicking on an image. Note that when
      one of the bottom row images is selected, and the corresponding
      video is playing, clicking on another image only has effect after
      the current bottom-row video has completed (15s) because the bottom row
      video's are contained within a <priorityClass peers="defer"> element.
      Using "View->Load Settings" allows 4 different presentation styles:
         Broadband-EN.xml (English captions, Slovakian videos)
         Broadband-SL.xml (Slovakian captions, Slovakian videos)
	 Web-EN.xml (English captions, images and Slovakian audios, bottom row videos)
	 Web-SI.xml (Slovakian captions, images and Slovakian audio, bottom row videos) 

   News/Danes2-CE.smil
      Small news presentation with images and Slovakian audio only.

7. Download and extract from www.ambulantplayer.org->SMIL 2.1 Tests the
   test suite covering new features only (4MB download). This contains
   about 70 small tests. These can be examined most easily by opening the file 
   NewS21functionalities.html and a Web browser after the browser has been setup
   to use the installed AmbulantPlayer for files with .smil extension.
   Then open each individual test as SMIL, it will play in a separate window.
   On all platforms keyboard shortcuts are available.
