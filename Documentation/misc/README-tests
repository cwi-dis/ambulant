The following test sequences are mandatory before release, to check
that at least everything we make public available works properly.

The term "platform" can be ambiguous in the case of ambulant, because
some installers are intended to run on rather diferent platforms, and
we want to test on the most common of those platforms.

Here is a suggested breakdown for where each installer is expected to
be used. The installer should be run on that platform, and the tests
described below should be executed. At least test sets B, D and E should
be run for all platforms.

1. Windows desktop installer.
	1.1. Install and test on virgin Windows XP
	1.2. Install and test on virgin Windows Vista
	1.3. Install and test on virgin Windows 7
	
	Make sure that (on at least one platform) all tests pass with ffmpeg/sdl renderers.
	Not all tests will pass with DirectX, but the Welcome and Demo documents should run.

2. MacOSX 10.4 desktop installer.
	2.1. Install and test on PPC mac running 10.4
	2.2. Install and test on Intel mac running 10.5
	
	Time permitting, try the other two combinations as well.
	
	Make sure that all tests pass with ffmpeg/sdl renderers as well as quicktime
	renderers.
	
3. MacOSX 10.6 desktop installer.
	3.1. Install on Intel mac running 10.6 (in default 64-bit mode)
	3.2. Set player to 32-bit mode, test again.
	
	For 32-bit mode, test quicktime renderer.
	
4. Windows Mobile 5 installer.
	4.1. Install and test on at least one WM5 device.
	
5. Source distribution.
	5.1. Build on most recent 32-bit Fedora Core distribution and test.
	5.2. Build on most recent 32-bit Ubuntu distribution and test.
	5.3. Build on at least one recent 64-bit Linux distribution and test.
	5.4. Build on at least one recent Windows machine with Visual Studio 2008. Do minimal testing.
	5.5. Build on at least one recent Mac (10.6). Do minimal testing.
	
6. Windows Firefox plugin.
	6.1. Install and test on virgin Windows XP
	6.2. Install and test on virgin Windows Vista
	6.3. Install and test on virgin Windows 7
	6.4. Install and test one at least one Windows machine that has Visual Studio installed.
	
7. Linux Firefox plugin (32-bit).
	7.1. Install and test in most recent FC distribution (with included Firefox).
	7.2. Install and test in most recent Ubuntu distribution (with included Firefox).
	
8. Linux Firefox plugin (64-bit)
	8.1. Install and test in at least one recent Linux 64-bit distribution.
	
9. MacOSX 10.4 Safari plugin.
	9.1. Install and test on PPC mac running 10.4
	9.2. Install and test on Intel mac running 10.5

10. MacOSX 10.6 Safari plugin.
	10.1. Install and test on Intel mac running 10.6 with Safari in 64-bit mode.
	10.2. Test again, now with Safari in 32-bit mode.
	
11. Windows IE plugin.
	11.1. Install and test on virgin Windows XP
	11.2. Install and test on virgin Windows Vista
	11.3. Install and test on virgin Windows 7
	
	If possible, test on at least one machine with IE7.
	

A.	(only for source distribution) build default: run the
	build-third-party-packages.py script and "configure", "make".
	This is the build that should be tested with the rest of the tests.
	(Rationale: non-guru Linux users should have a reasonable chance of
	building a working Ambulant).
	
	Next, build with as many options as possible (--with-live, --with-xerces,
   --with-plugins, --with-python, --with-xerces-plugin,
   --with-python-plugin), etc., depending on platform.
   Clear any preferences file in .ambulant  and start AmbulantPlayer.
   You should see the initial Welcome demo.
   (Rationale: everything should at least be built once).

B. Make sure that the demo tests work (and player controls as well):
   1. Welcome.smil
   2. NYC-SMIL2.smil (use File->Load Settings... to select Single/Multi audio)
   3. NYC-SmilText.smil (at least until "In Memoriam")

   In addition, in ambulant-documents:
   4. Flashlight-Desktop forward/backward navigation

C. Make sure that the zipped (or plugin) versions of our public demos work properly,
   these are available at http://ambulantplayer.org/Demos.shtml:
   1. smilText
   2. PanZoom
   3. Videotest
   4. Birthday
   5. Euros
   6. Flashlight (use forward/backward navigation)
   7. News (test exclusives: lowest 3 pictures) 
 
D. Make sure that the http versions of the tests at C. work properly.

E. Make sure that the rtsp versions of the tests at C. work properly.

F. Build and install Firefox plugin and verify that all tests at C.
   for plugin work properly.

The script Run-tests.sh excutes the sequences B-E automatically on
Linux or Windows (Cygwin only).

On Linux: (cd ../..;./configure --prefix=$HOME;make;make install)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib ./Run-tests.sh

On Windows, download Cygwin and the optional packages unzip (in Archive) and
wget (in Web). Install AmbulantPlayer, then in Cygwin command window type:
./Run-tests.sh
