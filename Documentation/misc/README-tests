The following test sequences are mandatory before release, to check
that at least everything we make public available works properly.

Supported platforms for Ambulant player/plugin+installer:
MacOS, WindowsCE (no plugin), WindowsXP(+ieambulant), Linux32, Linux64.

A. Build Ambulant as if it would be a distributed version: enable as
   much supported features as possible (--with-live, --with-xerces,
   --with-plugins, --with-python, --with-xerces-plugin,
   --with-python-plugin), etc., depending on platform.
   Clear any preferences file in .ambulant  and start AmbulantPlayer.
   You should see the initial Welcome demo.

B. Make sure that the demo tests work (and player controls as well):
   1. Welcome.smil
   2. NYC-SMIL2.smil (use File->Load Settings... to select Single/Multi audio)
   3. NYC-SmilText.smil (at least until "In Memoriam")

   In addition, in ambulant-documents:
   4. Flashlight-Desktop forward/backward navigation

C. Make sure that the zipped versions of our public demos work properly,
   these are available at http://ambulantplayer.org/Demos.shtml:
   1. smilText
   2. PanZoom
   3. Videotest
   4. Birthday
   5. Euros
   6. Flashlight (use forward/backward navigation)
   7. News (test exclusives: lowest 3 pictures) 
 
D. Make sure that the http versions of the tests at C. work properly.

E. Make sure that the rtsp versions of the tests at C. work properly.

F. Build and install Firefox plugin and verify that all tests at C.
   for plugin work properly.

The script Run-tests.sh excutes the sequences B-E automatically on
Linux or Windows (Cygwin only).

On Linux: (cd ../..;./configure --prefix=$HOME;make;make install)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib ./Run-tests.sh

On Windows, download Cygwin and the optional packages unzip (in Archive) and
wget (in Web). Install AmbulantPlayer, then in Cygwin command window type:
./Run-tests.sh
