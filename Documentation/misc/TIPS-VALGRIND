About vslgrind, kcachegrind and calltree.

valgrind is a system to find memory access errors and memory leaks.
In addition it can be used to find "hot spots" in program code
and the call trees of the functions leading to these hot spots.

Packages downloaded:
valgrind-2.1.1
calltree-0.9.7
kcachegrind-0.4.5
graphviz-1.12

In addition kde-devel must be installed
(only available via RPM, I used daniel's machine)

For "ntpl" kernels, use
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19
until valgrind handles "ntpl" properly.

Use "valgrind.supp" to get rid of some
useless messages.
