Ambulant on the Zaurus: Sharp SL-5600 PDA.
------------------------------------------

The easiest way to run AmbulantPlayer on your Zaurus is the following.

First, the package "SDL"  must have been installed on your Zaurus.
SDL can be found at:
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/feed/libSDL_1.2.6cvs-1_arm.ipk
http://www.gnurou.org/software/zaurus/feed/libSDL-mixer_1.2.5cvs-1_arm.ip
Both packages are needed.

For Ambulant:

A. Download the installation package "ambulantplayer_x.y_arm.ipk"
   from the the website "www.ambulant.org" using the Opera browser
   on your Zaurus. Assure to have at least 8Mb free disc space,
   verify with QtMenuIcon->Settings->SystemInfo->Storage, or,
   alternatively, use a SD or CF card with sufficient free space. 
   The Opera browser will ask you where to store the package
   (QtMenuIcon is the leftmost icon on the Taskbar at the bottom).

B. Install the ambulant package using the the Zaurus Software
   Installer by selecting: QtMenuIcon->Settings->Add/RemoveSoftware.
   Tap "Install packages", select "ambulantplayer", tap "Install".
   Select where you want it to be installed and tap "OK". After
   installation (~1 min) a "Finish install" window is displayed,
   asking you to "Close this application to complete the installation".
   Tap "OK" to get rid of this message and then do what the message
   asked yuo to do: close the "Package Installer" by tapping the "X"
   button at top-right, and close the ">Add/Remove Software" window
   again by tapping the "X" button at right-top. Only then is the
   installation really effectuated.
   Close the Opera browser and start it again to make it aware
   of the fact that "ambulantplayer" has been installed.

C. To run "AmbulantPlayer" the file selection mechanism of the
   Opera browser is used. Tapping 
   QtMenuIcon->Applications->OperaBrowser will start it.
   Then, in Opera, select "Open local file" in the Main Menu 
   (tap 2nd icon from left in Opera's "Main button bar" at the top 
   of Opera's window). There in "Show type" select "application/smil".
   An entry "Welcome" should become visible, since it was part of the
   ambulantplayer installation package. Tap "Welcome", and 
   "AmbulantPlayer" will play its Welcome tune.
   Any other valid ".smil" files which are present in a directory
   called "Documents" in "/home/zaurus", the SD or CF card, or
   subdirectories thereof will be shown by Opera as well and can
   be played by tapping the name of the document.

D. Uninstall the package by first closing "AmbulantPlayer" by
   tapping its "X" (close) button at right-top. Then use
   same procedure as described in section B., only now tab 
   "Uninstall packages" instead of "Install packages".
