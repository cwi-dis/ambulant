<h1>Submitting feedback on Ambulant Player</h1>

<p>If you encounter a bug in the player please report it to us. The best
way to report a bug is through the SourceForge bug tracker, you will find a
link <em>Bug Reports</em> to it on the 
<a href="http://www.ambulantplayer.org">AmbulantPlayer homepage</a>. Alternatively
you can mail your bug report to
<a href="mailto:ambulant-feedback@ambulantplayer.org">Ambulant-feedback@ambulantplayer.org</a>. <p>

<p>If the bug is repeatable you can help us a lot by providing the
debugging output, in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set <em>Log level</em> to <em>debug</em> in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.
<li>Stop and restart the player.
<li>Repeat the steps to demonstrate the bug.
<li>Show the Logging window, and copy the contents into a file.
<li>Tell us about your system: operating system and version, etc.
</ul>

<p>In addition information such as your operating system and version, and possibly
the document you were trying to play back are helpful. </p>
