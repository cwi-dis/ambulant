<h1>Using Ambulant Player</h1>

<p>To play a SMIL document from a local file you use the <em>File->Open</em>
command and select the file. Alternatively, methods customary on your
platform will also work, such as drag and drop of the document's icon
on Mac or Windows, or passing the filename on the command line on Unix.</p>

<p>To play a document over the network you use <em>File->Open URL</em> or
<em>File->Open Location</em> and type the URL.</p>

<p>Mac and Windows players allow simulaneous playback of multiple documents,
on Windows CE and Linux that is not supported in the current release. </p>

<p>In case of problems encountered during playback a dialog with a terse summary of
the problem will be displayed. More information can be found in the logging window,
which can be opened through <em>View->Log</em> or <em>File->Log Window</em>.
The amount of detail in the log window can be selected through the
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>

<p>In the preferences window you can also select how audio and video are
rendered, and how to access some resources over the net.</p>
