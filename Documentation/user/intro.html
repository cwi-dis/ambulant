<h1>Ambulant Player Introduction</h1>

<p>Ambulant Player is an Open Source player for SMIL 2.0 documents
(The full licensing details can be found in the <a href="developer.html">developer</a>
section of this help file). It is intended primarily for the research community,
and not as a replacement for commercial SMIL players such as the RealPlayer
or QuickTime: while the performance is at least on par with such players (in
our not so humble opinion:-) the Ambulant Player does not provide support
for the wide range of media encoding formats that such players support. </p>
