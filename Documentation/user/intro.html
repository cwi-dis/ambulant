<h1>Ambulant Player Introduction</h1>

<p>Ambulant Player is an Open Source player for SMIL 3.0 documents
(The full licensing details can be found in the <a href="developer.html">developer</a>
section of this help file). It is intended primarily for the research community,
and not as a replacement for commercial SMIL players such as the RealPlayer
or QuickTime: while the performance is at least on par with such players (in
our not so humble opinion:-) the Ambulant Player does not provide support
for the wide range of media encoding formats that such players support. </p>

<p>The Ambulant Player website,
<a href="http://www.ambulantplayer.org">www.ambulantplayer.org</a>, has background
information on the player and its design, demo documents, links to information on
the SMIL 3.0 standard and much more. </p>

<p>Ambulant Player comes with two example documents: the <em>Welcome</em>
document that you can play throught the <em>Help->Play Welcome document</em>
command and a sample audio-visual slideshow on New York, <em>NYC-SMIL</em>,
that is located in the installation directory. More sample documents can
be found on the <a href="http://www.ambulantplayer.org">Ambulant Player website</a>. </p>
