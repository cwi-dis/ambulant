<h1>Ambulant Player Preferences</h1>

<p>In the <em>Preferences</em> window (called <em>Settings</em> on some platforms)
you can set various change the way Ambulant Player handles some functions:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Log Level</em> allows you to change how verbose the log output will be.
In general <em>debug</em> is for developers only, <em>trace</em> is for people
creating SMIL documents and the higher levels are for all users.

<li> You can select the preferred XML parser to use. <em>Expat</em> is fast
and best for everyday use, but <em>Xerces</em> has the option to do some rigorous
syntax checking on your document, which is good if you are creating SMIL documents.
It gives you the option to check using either the <em>DTD</em> or the <em>Schema</em>
for the SMIL language, the DTD is the preferred way. If you check using the schema
you also have the option of doing some checking on the schema itself.

<li> On some platforms, you can enable or disable loading of plugins, which
enhance Ambulant Player with extra media types, etc.
</ul>
