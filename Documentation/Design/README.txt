Most of these are available as both .txtwith is ReStructured Text and HTML, which is the readable output form.Models has .graffle files which are graphics created with the Mac programOmniGraffle. The accompanying .pdf files are the output format.include has various C++ include files, but is not very up-to-date.Suggested reading instructions: print the text/*.html files and print the models/*.pdf files. Keep the graphics of the models handy to have a generaloverview of the object model. Start reading the overall.html document, thenread objects.html, then timelines.html.
