Ambulant Design Documentation
=============================

Currently the design documentation consists of the following
bits and pieces:

- `Overall`_ has a description of the design process and some high-level
  design decisions.
- `Walkthrough`_ is a quick walkthrough of the Ambulant Player playing
  a SMIL document. 
- `Objects`_ has descriptions of the main interfaces and classes used in Ambulant.
  Accompanying UML graphics can be found in the `models`_ subdirectory.
- `Organisation`_ explains the source code organisation and coding conventions.
- `API`_ is the developers documentation for all interfaces considered
  public. It may need to be regenerated with doxygen, see the README file
  in the `documentation directory`_ for details.
