Ambulant Design Documentation
=============================

Currently the design documentation consists of the following
bits and pieces:

- `Overall`_ has a description of the design documentation, the source
  code organisation, source code conventions and some high-level
  design decisions.
- `Objects`_ has descriptions of the various classes used in Ambulant.
  Accompanying UML graphics can be found in the `models`_ subdirectory.

.. _Overall: text/overall.html
.. _Objects: text/objects.html
.. _models: models

Two older documents that have not been integrated yet, and that may not be
up-to-date are `remarks.txt`_ and `sdd-schema.txt`_.

.. _remarks.txt: text/remarks.txt
.. _sdd-schema.txt: text/sdd-schema.txt
