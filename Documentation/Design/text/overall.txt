Ambulant design, overall
========================

Last updated for Ambulant version 1.1.

Design process
--------------

The design consists of a mixed bag of technologies:

- Text files such as this one for informal descriptions. They are marked
  up as reStructuredText_, a format easily converted to HTML
  but also readable in source form.
- C++ header files for class definitions and such.
- Image files for UML pictures.
  
.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
  
If possible all design documents will carry a notice stating for
which version of Ambulant they were last updated, so it is relatively
easy to spot outdated (or potentially outdated) documents.  
  
Global structure
----------------

To be able to use the code
to create, say, a plugin SMIL renderer for use in a browser we need a global
"playback engine" object that has all the others hanging off it (plus factory
methods to create them, etc). To support this we have a global object ``player``
that is the controller of all aspects of playback of a single SMIL document.

In addition we use factories for creating things like renderers, file readers,
parsers and windows. These factories are populated by the main program and then
used during document playback.

With a structure like this the application itself becomes basically a skeleton
embedder: it is responsible for the GUI, handling open/open URL/quit/etc, it creates
playback engine objects when needed and has a small number of callbacks for
"create window" and such.

In addition, because the main program is responsible for creating all the factories
it should be possible to create a different main program that does not actually
render anything, but only prints on stdout what should happen at what time, or
any other form of symbolic execution.

Replaceable components
----------------------

AmbulantPlayer is intended to be a research system, and therefore all components
should be easy to replace with interfering with the rest of the system. This
allows a researcher to concentrate on one issue, such as network protocols or
scheduling algorithms, while the rest of the system is usable as-is.

This replacability is incorporated in the design through two means:

- Clear well-defined APIs between the various parts of the system;
- Factory functions to create most objects.

In the current implementation there are two main objects for which this
has not been implemented (the DOM tree and the low-level event scheduler),
this will be done at a later stage. All other functionality (media playback,
data retrieval, parsing, layout, scheduling) does follow this pattern.

run-time system
---------------

Because we have a C++ implementation
we cannot rely on refcounting or garbage collection in the underlying runtime.
lib/refcount.h has a simple refcounting implementation that is used for
garbage collection.

Ref-counting should be used when it is absolutely needed, it adds an
overhead and some complexity since it can not happen automatically. On
the other hand there are some cases where it simplifies the code  a lot.
If I judge from my code and the code of others I have seen, only very
few objects need ref counting. First, objects owned by a class, and
quite all are, never need to be ref counted. You just delete them.
Ref-counting is needed when objects containing references are shared by
completely independent components.

The architecture is fairly tightly coupled. The original idea
of allowing the high-level scheduler to live on a different machine, precomputing
schedules and ending these to a low level scheduler, isn't going to work
for SMIL without putting almost all SMIL complexity in the low-level scheduler.

main loop
---------

The basic architecture is event-driven, with a small
number of worker threads picking up events from the event queue. The alternative
is to use multiple threads all over, but it seems event-driven is the better
choice. An object that wants to use multiple threads can do so more easily
on an event infrastructure than the other way around, but these threads are
"somebody else's problem", as they are hidden from the rest of the architecture.

At first glance that it appears some objects, such as a renderer,
would benefit from a threaded architecture it turns out this isn't really so.
The naive threaded implementation::

    while data = read_data():
    	render_data(data)

will not work, because many other things can also happen, such as a user-initiated
event, or the timeline for the renderer being torn down. So, the naive loop
sketched here will become hairy anyway, and look like::

	while event = wait_for_some_interesting_event():
		switch event:
			case DATA: render_data(data)
			case STOP: close_resources_and_exit()
			...

so we might as will split this out in the architecture.

The event handler architecture needs an elaborate priority scheme, that is expressive
enough that the best execution order of things that happen "at the same time"
is automatic.

Machine-dependent code
----------------------

The general way to handle machine-dependency is to create a machine-independent
abstract base class, plus machine-dependent subclasses. Then there is a factory
function that creates a machine-dependent instance and returns it casted
to its machine-independent base class.

With this scheme we can handle machine-dependent extensions to the base class
easily: modules using these extensions declare objects of the subclass and
call the initializer directly in stead of through the factory function.

The scheme does not work for all objects, however: it breaks if we want to
create static copies of the objects. For classes for which this is the case,
such as the ``critical_region`` object, we declare an abstract object 
``abstract_critical_section`` in
``lib/abstract_mtsync.h``, subclass that as ``PLATFORM::critical_section``
in ``lib/PLATFORM/PLATFORM_mtsync.h``,
conditionally include that in ``lib/mtsync.h`` and create an empty subclass
``critical_section`` of it. 

integrating third-party tools
-----------------------------

We need to be able to use existing toolkits that take work out of our hands.
Think of QuickTime and DirectX, where you basically pass a URL and say "play" and
have nothing to worry about anymore. Also, existing URL access libraries (such
as the caching infrastructure on windows) and a third party RTSP library need
to be used. This also means we don't have to handle firewalls and what more.

We would like to be able to re-use existing (Explorer, Netscape) plugins
when applicable, but no work on this has been done yet.

Other languages
---------------

It is our intention to eventually allow bridging of Ambulant Player to other languages
such as Python or Java. An effort has been made to keep the APIs clean enough
to allow this, but no actual work has been done on it yet.

Where next?
-----------

A good place to continue reading is the `walkthrough`_ document, which gives a terse
description of how a SMIL document is opened, parsed and played. Then continue
with the `objects`_ document which describes the main objects in more detail.
Or go back to the `main documentation index`_.
