The text files here are formatted in ReST, ReStructured Text, format.

A description of ReST, plus Python software to convert it to HTML,
can be found at <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>.

Once you have installed the docutils package into your python
you can re-create the html files with the Makefile here.

And if you couldn't be bothered to create the HTML files: the
ReST format was designed to be pretty readable in its raw form,
it is similar to the conventions people often use in ASCII mail and such.
