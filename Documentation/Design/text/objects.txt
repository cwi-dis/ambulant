Ambulant design, objects 
========================
Jack Jansen, 29-Apr-03.
-----------------------
Objects we need:

- Event processor. This is the mainloop plus the event/callback mechanism.
  TBD.
- Data Source. Think of these as "media items", they may refer to a URL
  or part of a multiplexed stream or so, and provide data to renderers and
  to the parser.
- Region. This is an area of screen space (or a speaker). It is "what
  the user sees".
- Data sink. This is where renderers send their data.
- Renderers. These decode data streams, handle timing and do bitblitting
  or push audio through.
- Clocks. These advance a virtual time.
- Document Scheduler. This reads a document and runs it.
- Timeline. This executes a single timeline.

Objects we may need:

- Resource. Control access to scarce resources (bandwidth, number of
  open files).

Data sources come in two flavors: active and dormant. These can be used
interchangeably (active is probably a subclass of dormant). Dormant has
URL, clip-begin/clip-end and such. Active also has methods for I/O.
Data sources are always (really always?) push-based: the client asks
for data, this call returns immedeately, and when the data is available
an event is fired. There is probably also a call that says "don't
send me the event until you have all the data that is there".

Some data sources will be able to handle some of the extra parameters
(clip-begin/end, ignore-repeat) itself, the rest will be passed to 
the renderer to handle.

XXX We need a "semi-active" data source, for the SMIL prefetch
element. This probably means we also need factory object for data sources,
which re-uses a semi-active data source when applicable. This lookup
happens when a data source goes from dormant to active.

A data sink is where data is sent. It is invoked with a SMIL region as
parameter, but multiple sinks can share a region, in which case
double-buffering for transitions and such happens there. It has no API
for graphics or such, this is handled by the renderers using the local
graphics APIs. A data sink can send a callback to the renderer for
"redraw" and "reinit". The latter is redraw on steriods: the underlying
OS window may have changed (end of transition, resize).

RendererFactory is called with a data source, data sink and a few other
parameters (such as "ignore implicit repeat in media item"). It returns
a renderer object. The factory can either return a dormant renderer,
which is only a placeholder, or a real renderer. To return a real
renderer, or when a dormant renderer is later activated, we ask all
known renderer classes whether they are able to handle this data source,
and instantiate the first one that matches.

The renderer object interface should allow for at least three different
implementations:

1. The normal one, where the renderer depends on the data source for
   data, decodes it, and sends it to the data sink.
2. A "third party" renderer, that just grabs the information from the
   data source and sink and passes it to a third party engine (think
   QuickTime or Direct X).
3. A mix of the above.

We need the dormant renderer object, which only holds the information
needed to allow later activation (on demand?). Otherwise resources may
become scarce: think of a seq with 1000 slides: we don't want to open
all images beforehand or we will run out of file descriptors. But
sometimes the document scheduler must open the data source, if the media
item is part of a switch, for instance.

Clocks come in two flavors. The normal flavor is a free-running clock, a
renderer that is subscribed to it can access it in two modes (depending
on what programming model it prefers): callback or polling. In callback
mode it will get callbacks when the virtual clock time has drifted more
than delta from the wallclock. In polling mode it can ask for the time
and ask for a callback at a specific time/interval. Renderers can also
tell the clock what time they think it is, but this is completely
ignored.

The other clock flavor is the master clock. Each normal clock can have
at most one master clock attached to it. The master clock has the same
API as a normal clock, from the renderer point of view, but it does not
give callbacks and it *does* listen when the renderer tells it what time
it is (and updates its dependent slave clock). The scheduler assigns a
master clock for the SMIL syncMaster attribute.

The SMIL Document Scheduler opens the document (through a data source)
and parses it into a tree. It then waits for the "play document" event.
Upon receipt it will create the timeline schedule for the root plus anything
that is on the same timeline. It creates the data sources and renderers,
pushes the whole timeline down and fires the event that sets the thing running.
The timeline schedule also contains preloads for the various media items.
Then it waits for more events (probably from the LL scheduler) and does
what is needed for them.

The timelines can also be pushed down early, in which case they
will start preloading. This can be used to do "jump optimization" on
user interaction: if the scheduler can guess where the user is going to
go it can push the schedule down early thereby giving better responsiveness.

The main data structure in a timeline is the the list of (prerequisites, action)
tuples. This is almost a petri-net: when all of the prerequisites have happend
then all action are triggered. There is a difference with a real petri-net in
that some of these tuples are "or" in stead of "and": as soon as any of the
prerequisites has fired the actions fire. We need a name for these tuples (and
node and event are already taken), "place" seems to be the petri-net standard
but I don't like it... 

Actions can either trigger another prerequisite, cause an event to be
sent to a renderer (play, stop, etc), trigger a clock callback later or
do an upcall to the document scheduler. These should probably all be
done through the event processor, so we can use it's priority scheme to
do things in the right order.

The timeline has a number of auxiliary objects: 

- the renderers used (with their data sources attached), 
- the clock (or master and slave clock), 
- probably more.
