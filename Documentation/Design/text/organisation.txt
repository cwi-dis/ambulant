Ambulant source code organisation
=================================

Last updated for Ambulant version 2.3.


directory organisation
----------------------

Everything is kept under CVS, on sourceforge. On Unix we use the standard *automake*,
*autoconf*, *configure* and *gcc* (version 3.2 or later) toolset to
build things. On Windows we use Visual Studio 2008. 

At the toplevel we have a number of subdirectories:

- ``Documentation`` will eventually contain all documentation, currently
  ``Design``, which is what you are reading now, and ``API``, which is
  low-level documentation of classes, methods, etc.
- ``include`` has all the C++ header files.
- ``src`` has all the sources, with the engine built as a library
  from the ``libambulant`` subdirectory, driver programs in ``player_macos``,
  ``player_mfc``, Python bridge in ``pyambulant``, etc.
- ``third_party_packages`` holds the source to third party packages we use,
  such as James Clark's ``expat`` XML parser, the IJG libjpeg library and more.
- ``Extras`` has the DTD cache files and the
  two included presentations, Welcome and DemoPresentation.
- ``po`` has the files used to create localisations. This uses the
  GNU gettext library.

Source code conventions
-----------------------

Here's a somewhat random list of source code conventions that we have decided
to use:

- Indent by tab only, with the following exceptions:

  - ``namespace`` doesn't indent at all
  - ``public:``, ``private:`` and such indent two spaces
  
- Whether opening braces are at end-of-line or beginning of the next
  line depends on the circumstances and personal taste. Closing braces,
  when on a line by themselves, must however align with the construct
  that opened them.
- No visual aligning of long argument lists with the opening parenthesis: it will not work.
  If you split an argument list, indent on tab. Preferably, when you split, put every argument
  on a separate line, and provide visual feedback on the next line.
- no camelCase, CamelCase or Capitalization in class or variable names
- Underscores to delimit words
- attribute names start with "m\_"
- static attributes start with "s\_"
- Code that is tightly-coupled to an external framework (such as GUI code)
  may relax the previous rules and adhere to the conventions of the external
  framework.
- semi-private classes go into into a namespace named "detail".
- Template type parameters start with an upper case letter
  (as in: ``template <class A> {}``)
- Interface classes are not flagged in a special way, but the default
  implementations of such an interface are: they have the interface name with
  ``_impl`` appended.
- Header files need to include any header files on which they depend, and
  they guard against multiple inclusion with a preprocessor construct.
- All files, headers and source, start with the copyright notice and license.
- Header files are all in an "ambulant" directory, and are included by full
  path, as in::
  
  	#include "ambulant/net/url.h"
  	
- Everything goes into namespace "ambulant", with sub-namespaces "lib",
  "net", etc. Machine-dependent code goes into it's own "unix", "win32", etc
  subnamespace of those.
- Source files have ``using namespace ambulant;`` at the top. In addition,
  there's a using namespace for your own namespace, i.e. ``using namespace common;``
  for source files in common. Normally, there are no other global ``using namespace``
  declarations, i.e. everything outside of your own namespace is used qualified.
- Header files that declare abstract interfaces try to include as few other
  header files as possible. In other words, if you need a ``lib::node *`` in an
  abstract header file it is better not to include ``ambulant/lib/node.h``,
  but instead to add a construct::
  
	namespace ambulant {
	namespace lib {
	class node;
	}
	}
	
- If you need to switch on platform in an ifdef please use the ambulant-specific
  constants: 
  ``AMBULANT_PLATFORM_MACOS``, 
  ``AMBULANT_PLATFORM_LINUX``,
  ``AMBULANT_PLATFORM_UNIX`` (any Unix variant), 
  ``AMBULANT_PLATFORM_WIN32`` (any Windows variant, including CE),
  ``AMBULANT_PLATFORM_WIN32_WCE`` (WinCE)
  
- APIs that could be considered external must be documented inline, in a form
  compatible with Doxygen. The easiest way to do this is with a triple-slashed
  comment block. The first line should end in a period and is the short description.
  Anything after that is the long description::
  	
  	/// Hold user preference information.
  	/// This class holds all settings the user can change. It is normally subclassed
  	/// in machine-dependent code to override the load() and save() methods.
  	class preferences {
  	
  		/// Load preferences from disk.
  		void load();
  		
  		/// Save preferences to disk.
  		void save();
  	}
