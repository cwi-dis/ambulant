<p>Here are some general (unstructured) thoughts on the Ambulant design.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could make the design language-independent, and
do it so that cross-language implementations are possible. This would not
only benefit people extending it in the long run, but could also jump-start
the initial implementation by re-using the existing GRiNS scheduler.</p>
<p>Boost.python may be a way to achieve C++/Python interoperability, this needs
to be investigated. Maybe Kleanthis knows more.</p>
<p>A point of concern is garbage collection. Because we want to do a C++ implementation
we cannot rely on refcounting or garbage collection (I think? Maybe there
is a C++ library or template or whatever that can handle this for us?)
so we have to be careful of object ownership and cleanup.</p>
<blockquote>
It seems that a variation on the STL autoptr is possible. We need to ask
KK for details on this (or other insight he has), and we also need to check
that this doesn't impact performance on handhelds overmuch.</blockquote>
<p>The architecture is going to be fairly tightly coupled. The original idea
of allowing the high-level scheduler to live on a different machine, precomputing
schedules and ending these to a low level scheduler, isn't going to work
for SMIL without putting almost all SMIL complexity in the low-level scheduler.</p>
<p>The basic architecture is going to be event-driven. The alternative
is to use multiple threads all over, but it seems event-driven is the better
choice. An object that wants to use multiple threads can do so more easily
on an event infrastructure than the other way around. Moreover, multiple
threads are always going to incur a performance penalty.</p>
<p>Also, although it seems at first glance that some objects, such as a renderer,
would benefit from a threaded architecture it turns out this isn't really so.
The naive threaded implementation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
while data = read_data():
    render_data(data)
</pre>
<p>will not work, because many other things can also happen, such as a user-initiated
event, or the timeline for the renderer being torn down. So, the naive loop
sketched here will become hairy anyway, and look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
while event = wait_for_some_interesting_event():
        switch event:
                case DATA: render_data(data)
                case STOP: close_resources_and_exit()
                ...
</pre>
<p>so we might as will split this out in the architecture.</p>
<p>The event handler architecture needs an elaborate priority scheme, that is expressive
enough that the best execution order of things that happen &quot;at the same time&quot;
is automatic.</p>
<blockquote>
A problem with the event handler is how to represent an event callback.
Ideally (in Python) it would be a tuple (anobject, amethod, arguments) and
it would call &quot;anobject-&gt;amethod(arguments)&quot;, but this is impossible in C++.
The equivalent (aboundmethod, arguments) also doesn't work, as C++ apparently
cannot represent a bound method. There may be a solution in using a common
base class CallbackHandler that declares virtual methods for all callback
types.</blockquote>
<p>We need to be able to re-use existing (Explorer, Netscape) plugins, when applicable.</p>
<p>We need to be able to use existing toolkits that take work out of our hands.
Think of QuickTime and DirectX, where you basically pass a URL and say &quot;play&quot; and
have nothing to worry about anymore. Also, existing URL access libraries (such
as the caching infrastructure on windows) and a third party RTSP library need
to be used. This also means we don't have to handle firewalls and what more.</p>
<p>The scheduler is going to be split in two. There is a high-level language
dependent scheduler and a low-level independent one. We will write a SMIL
high level scheduler, other people should be able to replace that with, say,
a QuickTime or MPEG-4 scheduler while re-using the low-level scheduler.</p>
<p>The Low-level scheduler is going to be based on fixed timelines. The HL
scheduler identifies a portion of the SMIL document that it can fit on a fixed
timeline (at least: a fully ordered linear timeline), it creates a schedule for this
and pushes it down. These low-level schedules look somewhat like a petri-net,
but they probably need &quot;or&quot; in addition to &quot;and&quot;. The LL schedule will contain
events that trigger the HL scheduler when needed (such as when the user clicks
a link, or when the schedule finishes). These timelines are what I referred to
in the past as &quot;multimedia basic blocks&quot;.</p>
<p>The elements in the timeline need enough information to be able to get back at
a HL object from them, so we do the annotation thing.</p>
<p>Timeline schedules are completely independent, at their level. If one timeline
kills or pauses another one this happens because it sends an event to the
HL scheduler which does the killing or pausing.</p>

<div class="section" id="missing">
<h1><a name="missing">Missing</a></h1>
<p>Here is a list of bits of the design that I know are missing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What an event looks like. In a dynamic language we could use a bound method
plus an optional argument, but this won't work in C++ (I think?).</li>
<li>What events are accepted by what objects, and what the arguments are.</li>
<li>How we handle anchors.</li>
<li>How we handle transitions.</li>
</ul>
