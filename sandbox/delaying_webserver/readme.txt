This is a webserver that has a fixed delay before serving a webpage (or other document).
Use this to test parallelism and such in Ambulant. Specify the delay with the -d option.

The server will serve from the current directory, but note that there is very little
pathname checking and such, so it may well open up your whole disk to internet access.
