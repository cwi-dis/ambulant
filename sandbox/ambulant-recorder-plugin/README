This directory contains a plugin for AmbulantPlayer_sdl.

It only works when SDL2 and Ambulant are installed.

By default, it implements a screen grabber for Ambulant_sdl,
that after each redraw grabs the screen content and outputs it.

When during a run of AmbulantPlayer_sdl the environment variable
AMBULANT_RECORDER_PIPE is set, the pipeline specified as the
value of AMBULANT_RECORDER_PIPE is opened and each frame grabbed
as displayed on screen is written on the pipe, in a format that
is understood by gstreamer element 'ambulantsrc' contained in
gstambulant-plugin-package.
If the special value 'dump' is used for the environment variable
AMBULANT_RECORDER_PIPE, each grabbed frame is written on a file
name '%0<timestamp>.bmp'.

When ambulant_recorder_plugin is configured with CXXFLAGS=-DWITH_AUDIO,
instead audio samples are written on the pipe, in a format that
is understood by gstreamer element 'ambulantsrc', when the latter
has been configured -DCFLAGS=-DWITH_AUDIO.


Older usages:
The file 'scripts/test-pipeline.sh' contains a complete example
that streams the screen images through 'rtsp://localhost:8554/test'
and can be viewed with the command vlc 'rtsp://localhost:8554/test'

The file 'scripts/webcam.sh' starts a RTSP server streaming the webcam
'/dev/video0' to 'rtsp://localhost:5544/webcam'

AmbulantPlayer with 'scripts/test2.smil' reads the video stream
'rtsp://localhost:5544/webcam' and displays it on screen.

AmbulantPlayer with 'scripts/test3.smil' reads the video stream
'rtsp://localhost:8544/test' and displays that on screen.
