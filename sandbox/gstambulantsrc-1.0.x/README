This directory contains a gstreamer plugin named 'ambulantsrc'
(based on gstplugin.c in gst-template from git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-template.git,
as described in Gstreamer Plugin  Writer's Guide).

It reads 'stdin' containing lines such as: 'Type: <fourcc>\nTime: <int>\n' 'Size: <int>\n' 'W: <int>\n' H: <int>\n',
followed by '<size>' bytes of binary data in BGRA format, which is output from ambulant-recorder-plugin.

After "./autogen.sh;make;sudo make intall", this input  will displayed by:

make check

which sets: export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 # change this appropriately when a --prefix 'configure' option value is used
and executes gst-launch-1.0 $GSTOPTIONS ambulantsrc ! videoconvert ! videoscale ! ximagesink < tests/input

There is initial support for audio (currently disabling video) with ./configure CFLAGS=-DWITH_AUDIO, then make check executes:
gst-launch-1.0 ambulantsrc ! audiorate ! audioconvert  ! audioresample ! alsasink sync=false < tests/Welcome-audio-raw
