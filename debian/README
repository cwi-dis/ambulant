This directory is supposed to contain everything necessary
to create an Ambulant installer for the Nokia770.

It is *NOT* intended for "normal" debian installers.
The files in ambulantplayer-app.tar needs to be extracted:

tar xf ambulantplayer-app.tar

This creates a directory  ambulantplayer-app which
a.o. contains a partial mirror filesystem which will
be copied verbatim during installation on the Nokia770.

To create an installer for Nokia770, go to the top-level
ambulant directory inside the scratchbox and type:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

The installer will be deposited in the parent directory
of  the top-level ambulant directory.
