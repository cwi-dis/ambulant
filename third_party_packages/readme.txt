This directory contains third-party packages used to build Ambulant.
Here is a list of the packages, where they come from, plus the versions:

expat-src:
	James Clark's expat XML parser library, version 1.95.6. Download 
	via <http://expat.sourceforge.net>.
expat-win32:
	Ditto, but installed with the win32 binary installer (it seems
	to be difficult to build from the source).
