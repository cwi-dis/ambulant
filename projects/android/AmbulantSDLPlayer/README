Build Ambulant for Android
--------------------------

Install Android development environment including ndk-build.
(see: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Set PATH to include new build commands (in tools, build-tools and platform-tools)

cd .../projects/android/jni
bash third-party-packages.sh
ndk-build
cd ..
ant debug install


Eclipse with Android ADT can be used too, but it gets often completely nuts
while building w. ndk-build and ant works smoothly.

When it works, it is fantastic, especially for debugging.


Sometimes I needed to compile java files by hand (in src/org/libsdl/app):
javac -bootclasspath /export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/platforms/android-19/android.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/effects.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/usb.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/maps.jar *.java
and copy the .class files to bin/classes/org/libsdl/app.
