Build Ambulant for Android
--------------------------

Install Android development environment including ndk-build.
(see: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Set PATH to include new build commands (in tools, build-tools and platform-tools)

cd .../projects/android/jni
bash prepare-ndk-build.sh
ndk-build
cd ..
ant debug install


Eclipse with Android ADT can be used too, but it gets often completely nuts
while building with ndk-build and ant works smoothly.

When it works, Eclipse is fantastic, especially for debugging.

- make sure you have in your PATH at earliest login time:
  - android-sdk-linux/tools
  - build-tools
  - platform-tools
  - tools
  - android-ndk-r9d

- set export=NDKROOT=<android-ndk-r9d>

In Eclipse->Window->Preferences->Android_NDK, select proper NDK location


Sometimes I needed to compile java files by hand (in src/org/libsdl/app):
javac -bootclasspath /export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/platforms/android-19/android.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/effects.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/usb.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/maps.jar *.java
and copy the resulting .class files to bin/classes/org/libsdl/app.


When re-starting from scratch on Ubuntu-13.10-x86_64, I had to do (in addtition to the
install instructions from the android developer website);
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 
sudo apt-get install lib32z1

In Eclipse->Help->Install New Software->Available Software Sites,
add the following (assuming Eclipse version 'Juno' or 3.8):

http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/juno
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

In both cases, before building AmbulantSDLPlayer some external packages
need to be available:

1. ffmpeg-2.0.2 needs to be been installed according to instructions found in:
   http://www.roman10.net/how-to-build-ffmpeg-with-ndk-r9/

   Be aware to the setting of the environment variables
   NDK=<android-ndk-r9c>, and
   NDK_MODULE_PATH=<android-ndk-r9c>/sources

2. Other third party packages need to be downloaded using the script:
   jni/prepare-ndk-build.sh

Building with command line tools:

-> ndk-build -j9 clean
-> ndk-build -j9
-> ant debug install

Run AmbulantSDLPlayer on the device (see below now) and use:
-> adb logcat
to see error messages.

Also, AmbulantSDLPlayer writes its own logs in: '/sdcard/ambulant.log',
can be viewed with:

-> adb shell
--> cat /sdcard/ambulant.log

Using  AmbulantSDLPlayer.
-------------------------

AmbulantSDLPlayer has no GUI, but can be started from any Internet Browser
or some File Manager, by tapping a link representing a .smil file, e.g.
those marked 'http' on http://ambulantplayer.org/Demos.shtml)

Also, for downloaded files, the (free) File Browser 'Total Commander' can be used
to start AmbulantSDLPlayer, by clicking any '.smil' file.

When the orientation changes (portrait/landscape), AmbulantSDLPlayer adapts properly.
When the 'BackButton' (left middle bottom icon) is tapped, AmbulantSDLPlayer stops.


State of the Android implementation.
----------------------------------

SDL_TTF is used for smilText rendering, almost all of smilText has
been implemented and tested, except:
textWritingMode (not tested)
textDirection (not tested)
textFontFamily (not tested, only 1 font availble for Android)

Known bugs and limitations:

audio for .mp4 video is broken.
When started from Web Browser, AmbulantSDLPlayer does not return to the Browser
that started it.
