Build Ambulant for Android
--------------------------

Install Android development environment including ndk-build.
(see: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Set PATH to include new build commands (in tools, build-tools and platform-tools)

cd .../projects/android/jni
bash third-party-packages.sh
ndk-build
cd ..
ant debug install


Eclipse with Android ADT can be used too, but it gets often completely nuts
while building w. ndk-build and ant works smoothly.

When it works, it is fantastic, especially for debugging.

- make sure you have in your PATH at earliest login time:
  - android-sdk-linux/tools
  - build-tools
  - platform-tools
  - tools
  - android-ndk-r9d

- set export=NDKROOT=<android-ndk-r9d>

In Eclipse->Window->Preferences->Android_NDK, select proper NDK location


Sometimes I needed to compile java files by hand (in src/org/libsdl/app):
javac -bootclasspath /export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/platforms/android-19/android.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/effects.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/usb.jar:/export/scratch2/kees/Eclipse/SDKs/add-ons/addon-google_apis_x86-google-19-1/libs/maps.jar *.java
and copy the .class files to bin/classes/org/libsdl/app.


When re-starting from scratch on Ubuntu-10.13-x86_64, I had to do (in addtition to the
install instructions from the android developer website);
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 
sudo apt-get install lib32z1

In Eclipse->Help->Install New Software->Available Software Sites,
add the following (assuming Eclipse version 'Juno' or 3.8):

http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/juno
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Building with command line tools:

ndk-build -j9 clean
ndk-build -9
ant debug install
