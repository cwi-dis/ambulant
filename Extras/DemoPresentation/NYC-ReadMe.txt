The NewYorGeo Demo
--------------------------
The purpose of this demo is to show a simple SMIL slideshow


Versions:
--------------------------
 - NYC-MMS.smil:   A simple MMS slideshow for a MMS telephone size device.
 - NYC-SMIL2.smil: A version of the slideshow with higher quality audio and images 
                   in PocketPC dimensions


Suggested Run Sequence:
---------------------------
1. Both versions should work on all platforms.

2. In NYC-SMIL2.smil, either a single or multi-channel audio version can be played.
   To experience the single-channel version (this is the default):
   a. open the NYC-SMIL2.smil presentation
   b. stop the presentation if it auto-starts
   c. go to View->Load Settings
   d. select the SingleAudio.xml settings file in this directory
   e. hit play

   To experience the multi-channel version:
   a. open the NYC-SMIL2.smil presentation
   b. stop the presentation if it auto-starts
   c. go to View->Load Settings

   The difference between the two versions is in the background music.
