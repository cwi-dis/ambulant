Instructions for build Ambulant from CVS
========================================

These instructions are currently for unix only, Windows instructions will
follow later.

NOTE: It appears that steps 2, 3, 4 and 6 can be replaced by a simple
invocation of "autoreconf", if you have it.

1. Check out the CVS tree (which you have presumably done already).

2. Create a symlink ltmain.sh. On most platforms the original will
   be in /usr/share/libtool/ltmain.sh::
   
   	% ln -s /usr/share/libtool/ltmain.sh .
   
   (autoreconf should probably do this for you)
   
3. Create the autoconf helper files::

	% aclocal

4. Create the missing automake files and Makefile.in files::

	% automake -a
	
5. Install expat, ffmpeg and sdl, as explained in third_party_packages/readme.txt.
   
6. Create configure from configure.in::

	% autoconf
	
7. Create the Makefiles::

	% ./configure
	
8. Build::

	% make
	
9. On MacOSX you need to build the player separately using XCode::
	
	% open src/player_macosx/cocoambulant.pbproj
