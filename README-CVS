Instructions for building Ambulant from CVS
===========================================

These instructions are currently for unix only, Windows instructions will
follow later.

1. Check out the CVS tree (which you have presumably done already).

2. Install expat, ffmpeg and sdl, as explained in third_party_packages/readme.txt.

3. Run autoconf, aclocal, automake and configure::

    % ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I m4" ./autogen.sh
   
4. Optionally, ff you want to build in a subdirectory (keeping the source tree clean)
   you should now clean out the Makefiles and such, and re-create them
   in your build-dir::
   
    % make distclean
    % cd build
    % ../configure
    	
5. Build::

	% make
	
5. On MacOSX you need an extra step to build and install the player::
	
	% cd src/player_macos
	% make install
